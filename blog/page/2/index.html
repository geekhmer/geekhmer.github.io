</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. ZuckNet</strong><br/>
  Mark’s father – Edward Zuckerberg was a dental practitioner, who ran his clinic from the first floor of their home. This made communication between the family members a hassle, because everyone was always running up and down the stairs. To combat with this problem, 11 year old Zuckerberg came up with the idea of an intranet that allowed anyone to login from any computer in the house and send a message. This served as an instant chat system, that was exclusive just to the Zuckerberg family. Randi Zukerberg, Mark’s elder sister, later told People.com how his this was &#8220;the first example of when he started building things-and he never stopped.&#8221;
</p>




<p>
  Another interesting fact about ZuckNet is that it was quite similar to the very popular AOL instant that into existence, later the same year. To quote Randi again, Mark was &#8216;10 levels ahead&#8217; even at 11.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Synapse Media Player</strong><br/>
</p>




<p>
  <img src="/images/synapse.jpg" width="500" alt="4 Startups Mark Zuckerberg Created Before Facebook" />
</p>




<p>
  In high school, Zuckerberg wrote a computer program that used machine learning to determine a user&#8217;s music listening habits and recommended more music based on the genre, artist, taste, which was pretty much like what Last.fm does today. This app was built in 2000, and was featured by SlashDot and PC magazine back then with an amazing review + a rating of 3 on 5.
</p>




<p>
  Both Microsoft and AOL approached Zuckerberg for buying Synapse + a job offer, but he turned them down and posted the app online for free. He also turned down a full-time employment opportunity at the two corporate giants and went on to enroll at Harvard.
</p>




<p>
  An excerpt from the review: &#8220;This is by far the most innovative media player I have see to date the only function I find it lacking is a more advanced tag editor and the ability to group by Album.&#8221;
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. CourseMatch</strong><br/>
  By the time Zuckerberg started classes at Harvard, he was already known as the, &#8216;Programming prodigy&#8217;. As an early project in his sophomore year, he started CourseMatch, which helped the students at Harvard in picking the courses they want, at the start of every semester. Through CourseMatch, you could see the number of students enrolled in a particular course and a list of all the people who signed up for the same course, allowing you to find out all the courses your class-mates were taking, before making a choice.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>4. FaceMash</strong><br/>
</p>




<p>
  <img src="/images/facemash.jpg" width="500" alt="4 Startups Mark Zuckerberg Created Before Facebook" />
</p>




<p>
  FaceMash is by far the most talked about things that Zuckerberg created as it is said to have initiated the beginning of Facebook. FaceMash presented the user with two pictures of either male or female students at Harvard and asked them to choose the better looking one.
</p>




<p>
  Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg&#8217;s room-mate at Harvard explained that he had built the Website &#8216;just for fun&#8217;.
</p>




<p>
  The Website soon went viral after its launch over the weekend. The traffic was so overwhelming that it lead to the shutting down of one of the Harvard’s network switches making it impossible for a group of students to access the internet.
</p>




<p>
  The site was taken down by Harvard management four hours later, after multiple complaints from students stating that their pictures were used in FaceMash without prior permission.
</p>




<p>
  FaceMash also landed Zuckerberg into trouble.He was brought before the administrative board and was charged with  violation of internet privacy rules and reach of computer security. He was made to publicly apologize, while the student paper wrote articles about how &#8216;inappropriate the whole concept of FaceMash was&#8217;.

  <img src="/images/52_simple _things.png" width="500" alt="52 Simple Things to Be Your Best Every Day" />
</p>




<p>
  Millions of people go to work every day, but they don&#8217;t bring the best parts of themselves to the job&#8211;often because they don&#8217;t know how. They may be stuck in a rut, never quite able to feel they&#8217;re doing truly excellent work.
</p>




<p>
  If you like what you do and you want to take it to the next level, concentrate on these 52 simple things.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Make people feel special:</strong> encourage and empower people at every chance.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Find work you love and put your heart and soul into it:</strong> choose a job you love and you will never have to work another day in your life.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Focus on the task at hand:</strong> do the best you can where you are with what you have.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>4. Treat every task as important:</strong> every job is a self-portrait of the person who does it.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>5. Always do the right thing, even when it&#8217;s hard:</strong> don&#8217;t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>6. Delegate whenever you can:</strong> you get the best out of people when you believe in their talent.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>7. Take initiative:</strong> even if you&#8217;re already very good at your job, do whatever you can to push your limits.
</p>

  <strong>8. Be part of the solution:</strong> don&#8217;t be known as someone who is always complaining about something.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>9. Tell the truth:</strong> let people know they can count on you to be honest even when it creates difficulties.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>10. Help as many people as you can along the way:</strong> become someone people seek out for assistance.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>11. Avoid gossip always:</strong> it should go without saying, but turn a deaf ear to gossip and rumors.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>12. Maintain a positive attitude:</strong> a positive attitude is always contagious.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>13. Double your income by tripling your knowledge:</strong> don&#8217;t let your knowledge and skills become outdated.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>14. Mind your emotions:</strong> when you&#8217;re angry, count to 10; before you speak, count to 100.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>15. Make small daily improvements for stunning results:</strong> most of the time, success consists of a series of little daily efforts.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>16. Sharpen your skills and focus on mastering your talents:</strong> avoid boredom&#8211;and learn a new skill to keep you on top of your game.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>17. Be masterful at what you do despite the obstacles:</strong> no person fails who does their best.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>18. Don&#8217;t feed your fears:</strong> have faith that you will make it through.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>19. Always be prepared:</strong> success occurs when opportunity meets preparation.

<p>
  <strong>22. Be all that you can be:</strong> don&#8217;t settle for less than your highest potential.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  <img src="/images/happy_ruby_on_rails.jpg" width="400" alt="Sessions Expiring" />
</p>




<p>
  To improve user security, we may wish to expire the user&#8217;s session after they are inactive for a given amount of time. In order to do this, we simply set the <code>expire_after</code> parameter when setting up our session store. For example:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/session_store.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">application</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">session_store</span> <span class="ss">:cookie_store</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">key</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;_example_session&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expire_after</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">minutes</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  The line above would expire the session after 15 minutes of inactivity. This means that the user&#8217;s session variables would get wiped once time reaches 15 minutes since the user last accessed the Rails application. If the user refreshes the page, the timer gets refreshed.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  I had a task to analyse the value of a cookie set by a tool on the subdomain. The value of the cookie set looked something like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;18337|20120404|True#Q0A|18342|21-30|20120404|18344#Q1|18349|NO PARTNER|20120404|18351#Q2|18352|EMPLOYED|20120404|18353#Q4|18432|STRUGGLING|18539|WANT|20120404|18541#Q3|18358|EMPLOYED|20120404|18359#&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  My task was to try to decipher the values of set inside the cookie and how they changed depending on the progress through the application that set the values. I was told the answers to questions sat next to the ID of the question. For example, the answer to the &#8220;age&#8221; question (21-30) was related to the question 18342 and would always appear as |18342|21-30|. I started out with some tests and ended up with a method like this:
</p>

<p>
  Of course, I wanted to avoid the growing if-else statement so found a way that I could do it dynamically and focus just on the mapping from an ID to an attribute. The resulting code looked like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>
  By the end of the analysis, I discovered that multiple IDs mapped to the same properties and all I had to do was add another entry into the map defining which ID mapped to what property on the object.

<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  If you&#8217;re using Ruby on Rails with Twitter Bootstrap or other css framworks, then you may want to display flash messages with the alert styles. Here is a quick and easy way of doing so.
</p>




<p>
  You just need to quickly extend <code>application_helper.rb</code> with the following:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application_helper.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">ApplicationHelper</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bootstrap_class_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">flash_type</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">flash_type</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">when</span> <span class="s2">&quot;success&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s2">&quot;alert-success&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">when</span> <span class="s2">&quot;error&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s2">&quot;alert-danger&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">when</span> <span class="s2">&quot;alert&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s2">&quot;alert-warning&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">when</span> <span class="s2">&quot;notice&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="s2">&quot;alert-info&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">else</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">flash_type</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Now when you call a flash message, you can use the following in your view:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% flash.each </span><span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;div class=&quot;alert &lt;%= bootstrap_class_for(type) %&gt;</span> <span class="n">alert</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dismissible</span><span class="s2">&quot; role=&quot;</span><span class="n">alert</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">    &lt;button type=&quot;</span><span class="n">button</span><span class="s2">&quot; class=&quot;</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="s2">&quot; data-dismiss=&quot;</span><span class="n">alert</span><span class="s2">&quot; aria-label=&quot;</span><span class="no">Close</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;</span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">    &lt;%= message %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  And just use:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">flash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:success</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Credit card type saved successfully!&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  As success message:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">flash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:alert</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Alerting you to the monkey on your car!&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

<p>
  With all the hate, all the times I’ve been called a spammer, scammer, deceptive, and just about every other negative thing you can imagine, it would be easy for me to quit. So what keeps me going?
</p>




<p>
  It’s true. I get a lot of very negative feedback on the things I do.
</p>




<p>
  It hurts. It sucks. It makes me want to quit. But I keep going anyways. Because every now and then, I get an email from guys in USA&#8230; an email that gives me fuel for the fire that I’ve started&#8230; an email that makes me believe that what I am doing is important – not for me, not because I have anything special or unique, but because my mundane and ordinary problems and solutions are the same mundane and ordinary problems that other people need to solve. And sometimes, the impact of my solutions are far beyond anything that I ever expected.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>That One Moment Of Impact</strong><br/>
  So why do I keep going? It’s that one positive note&#8230; that tweet from some random person&#8230; that person who takes the time to reply to an email and let me know that I’ve made an impact&#8230; this is why I do what I do.

</p>




<p>
  If you’ve ever written a line of Ruby, you’ve been impacted by the work of Jim Weirich: developer, teacher, mentor, speaker. By all accounts, he was a great person. Was… Sadly, Jim died recently.
</p>




<p>
  I didn’t know Jim, personally. In fact I only recently met him in person for the first time at Reddot ruby conf 2014 in Singapor. I had the pleasure of meeting him very briefly, introducing myself. It was great to finally say &#8220;hi&#8221; to him, though. I learned a lot from his talks and I still use his ideas of &#8220;protocols&#8221; instead of &#8220;interfaces&#8221; in dynamic languages like Ruby and JavaScript. But I’m not going to go in to some lengthy soliloquy about Jim’s life and impact on me.
</p>




<p>
  What really struck me about Jim’s passing was not the impact he had on me, personally, but the impact that he had on a very large number of developers around the world. For a few days after his death, I saw a countless number of tweets and retweets about how Jim had touched people’s lives. I saw stories of how he had changed people’s perspectives on code, on mentoring, and all other aspects of software development. One tweet in particular stuck out, talking about how Jim’s knowledge and wisdom had made this person realize their own inadequacies and how Jim was the only person they had ever met who had been gracious enough to apologize for that.
</p>




<p>
  All of these tweets, the thousands of comments posted on Jim’s last commit in Github, that software development companies around the world paid tribute to him via their public websites – the stories, the lives touched – all of this has me wondering: what will they say of me, when I’m gone? And what will they say about you? Will you have made an impact on the lives of other developers? Will you have shared your knowledge, sought opportunities to teach, entertain and enrich the lives of others?
</p>




<p>
  What impact have you had on the lives of others? What will they say about you, when you’re gone?

  <img src="/images/code_with_me.jpg" width="500" alt="I Should Write Bad Code More Often" />
</p>




<p>
  I’ve spent most of my career writing bad code – code that is ugly, hard to read, hard to understand, darn near impossible to update and fix problem. It’s bad code, not because it didn’t satisfy the original needs, but that it did so in a way that was not maintainable.
</p>




<p>
  Most people (myself included) look at the code they just wrote and think about how great it is; how it’s so easy to read and understand, and how they will be able to use this code to do so many things. The thing that we forget, is that we are always looking at the code we just wrote through the eyes of context and short term memory. Of course I understand how that function works – I just wrote it. But in a few months, weeks, days… sometimes hours? Well…
</p>




<p>
  For most of my career, though, I’ve had this lofty ideal of writing great code all the time. Worse yet, I’ve had this delusion that my code is somehow better than the code that I was reading from other people. But as I continue to grow and learn, in invariably look back at my old code and think about how bad it is. I’ve come to realize – albeit slowly, over many years – that this is ok for a couple of reasons.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>You’re Learning</strong><br/>
  Most of the bad code that I write is because I’m learning – learning a new language, a new framework, a new tool, a new API, a new … something. When we’re learning, we don’t know the answers yet. That’s why it’s learning – to find the answers.
</p>




<p>
  To find the answers, though, we have to solve the problem at least once – and there’s a good chance that the code we write will be bad, the first time we solve it. We can’t be concerned with good abstraction, clean code, elegance, simplicity or maintainability when we’re in learning mode. We have to focus on succinct, to the point, solve the immediate problem styles of coding with little to no regard for 10 minutes from now, let alone 10 days from now. This is the nature of learning.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>You’re Ready To Learn</strong><br/>
  If you know you’re writing bad code, then you’re already one step ahead of the game. Knowing that the code you’re writing is a sign that you know you can improve. It’s a sign that you want to improve. It’s also a sign that you are ready (or almost ready) to take the next steps to improve.
</p>




<p>
  Recognizing your own code as bad code is a sign of learning. That code you wrote 3 months ago, which you are now embarrassed to look at? That’s a good sign. It means you’ve learned since then. The code you’re writing for your current project, which keeps giving you bad feelings and making you nervous? At least that is recognition of the need to learn.
</p>




<p>
  Recognizing your own code as bad is one of the best things you can do for yourself, you projects and your career because it means you want to learn and improve.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>The Learning Experience</strong><br/>
  The real problem with bad code isn’t the code itself. The real problem stems from confusing the learning experience with solving problems for production systems. Far too often, we allow code that we know is bad to become production code. Sometimes this can’t be helped. Sometimes it isn’t a bad thing, either. But most of the time, the bad code that we wrote while learning shouldn’t be put in production.
</p>




<p>
  Learning should be done in throw away projects, samples and demos. Rather than trying to learn how to use that library in your production code, build a demo app that mimics your production needs (to a minimum). Instead of deciding to use a new framework for the first time when starting a new project, take some time to play with it first. Dig in a little deeper than you think you need to, and try to understand how it works and why.
</p>




<p>
  Separating the learning process from the production code process is important. Taking the time to learn how to solve a problem will produce better code and better understanding of the problem when you get back to your production system. You’ll be better equipped to deal with edge cases, additional requirements and other issues that don’t show up the first time you solve sometime.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Write Bad Code</strong><br/>
  You may not always have control over timelines. You might not have time to write a sample project for every idea., and sometimes you don’t have a choice but to release bad code. This is the reality in which we live. But I encourage you to to try, whenever possible, to write bad code knowing that you will be throwing it away once you start working on the production-ready solution.
