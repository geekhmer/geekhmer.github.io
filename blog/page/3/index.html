  <img src="/images/happy_ruby_on_rails.jpg" width="400" alt="How to Use link_to in Ruby on Rails?" />
</p>




<p>
  Even after many years of using Ruby on Rails I still have trouble remembering how to properly use all those options available for the link_to helper. Three out of five times I have to fire up the docs and search for the examples (cause that&#8217;s how I like to read the docs).
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Having Documentation in Hand</strong><br/>
  Using documentation locally is helpful, especially if you can integrate it into your editor. Personally I&#8217;m using the <code>ri</code> docs with Vim but I guess all those other editors can be configured to access it. If not you can always use ri in your terminal of choice.
</p>




<p>
  Another favourite of mine is the awesome ApiDock. You can even see other people&#8217;s comments on the docs and in many cases there you can find examples that are not present in the official docs.
</p>




<p>
  Another very good option (if you&#8217;re on a mac) is to use Dash. It&#8217;s easy to integrate in your editor or you can just fire it up with a system shortcut whenever you need to access the docs.
</p>




<p>
  That being said, I&#8217;m gonna list out a few of the more common examples I use in hopes that they will be useful for both you and me whenever I need to revisit <code>link_to</code>&#8217;s docs again.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>The Simplest Form</strong><br/>
  The most common and straightforward way of using <code>link_to</code> is to create a barebones (no magic) link. So, assuming your root route points to &#8216;/&#8217;, the way you would use the helper is:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Home&quot;, root_path %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Home</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>Link-ing to a Resource</strong><br/>
  Another common variant is linking to a resource (a user&#8217;s profile for example). Let&#8217;s say the user&#8217;s model is called User and that a @user ivar points to the user record who&#8217;s id is 1. Creating a link to the user&#8217;s profile will look like the following:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Profile&quot;, user_path(@user) %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/users/1&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Profile</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  There&#8217;s also a shorter version that will do the same thing. It&#8217;s got some magic to it (like most things in Rails) but it also looks prettier and there&#8217;s less to type (two stones with one bird).
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Profile&quot;, @user %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/users/1&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Profile</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>Using link_to with a Block</strong><br/>
  This is somewhat of a lesser known/used option of <code>link_to</code> but it&#8217;s useful nonetheless and it also makes the code more readable. So in those cases where the link text is long and/or ugly, or it doesn&#8217;t really fit on a 80 chars line, you can pass the link text inside a block.
</p>




<p>
  To make the example more obvious, I&#8217;m gonna do a before and after kind of thing.
</p>




<p>
  Before:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;&lt;span class=</span><span class="s1">&#39;home-link&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Home</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/span&gt;&quot;.html_safe, root_path %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr"># =&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;</span><span class="n">home</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">link</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  After:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to root_path do %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">content_tag</span> <span class="ss">:span</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Home&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:class</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;home-link&quot;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;home-link&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  In this case I&#8217;ve purposely chosen a less uglier link text, but usually the link text will be something like an image tag or a span with an icon inside it (or any other ugly html code you can think of).
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Adding html classes and/or id to Your Link</strong><br/>
  Another very common task you&#8217;ll use is to add a html class or id to your links.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Section&quot;, root_path, :class =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my-class&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:id</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my-id&quot;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span> <span class="n">class</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;my-class&quot;</span> <span class="nb">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;my-id&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Section</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>How to Delete a Record with link_to</strong><br/>
  Calling the <code>destroy</code> action of a REST-ful controller requires a <code>DELETE</code> request and that can be easily achieved by passing the <code>:method => :delete</code> hash as an option to the <code>link_to</code> helper.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Remove&quot;, @user, :method =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:delete</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;nofollow&quot;</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">method</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;delete&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/users/1&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Remove</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Note that the <code>rel="nofollow"</code> is auto-magically added by Rails as an SEO bonus.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Require Confirmation for Deleting a Record</strong><br/>
  You will probably want some sort of confirmation when removing objects to prevent accidental deletes. The easiest way to add that is with a simple javascript alert box that will ask the user to confirm his delete request.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Remove&quot;, @user, :method =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:delete</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:data</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:confirm</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;You Sure?&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">confirm</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;You Sure?&quot;</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;nofollow&quot;</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">method</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;delete&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/users/1&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Remove</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>Link-ing to an Image with link_to</strong><br/>
  It might be that you want to make your links prettier or that you want to have some nice buttons, or even a logo click-able or whatever the reason for using click-able images is, you&#8217;ll want to add your image inside the link. Making an image link-able is pretty straight forward. Just add the <code>image_tag</code> where the link text would go and you&#8217;re done.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to image_tag(&#39;logo.png&#39;), root_path %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="n">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/assets/logo-c88948e05e11587af2c23747862ca433.png&quot;</span> <span class="n">alt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Logo&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  You can also pass the image in a block if you like that style better.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to root_path do %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">image_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;logo.png&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/logo-c88948e05e11587af2c23747862ca433.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  A nice side-effect of using the <code>image_tag</code> helper is that it will add the asset digest to your image.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Adding an alt Attribute to the Image</strong><br/>
  As you&#8217;ve seen in the previous example, I didn&#8217;t specify an alt attribute but the link_to helper generated one. The generated alt tag is just the name of the image file, capitalized. In case you want (and you should want) to override the alt attribute, it&#8217;s very easy to do; just add your own alt attribute like so:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to image_tag(&#39;logo.png&#39;), root_path, :alt =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;MyLogo&quot;</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="n">img</span> <span class="n">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/assets/logo-c88948e05e11587af2c23747862ca433.png&quot;</span> <span class="n">alt</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;MyLogo&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Alt attributes are beneficial for SEO purposes and they also aid those visitors who use text readers or non graphical browsers.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Link-ing to an Image</strong><br/>
  There are times when you might want to link to an image (not necessarily with an image). This can be confusing because you need your image to contain the image digest generated by the asset pipeline. There&#8217;s a helper that provides just that and it&#8217;s called <code>image_path</code>.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Logo&quot;, image_path(&#39;logo.png&#39;) %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/assets/logo-c88948e05e11587af2c23747862ca433.png&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Logo</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>Anchors with link_to</strong><br/>
  You might need to point to a specific section (anchor) in the page which you can identify by it&#8217;s dom ID. So let&#8217;s say on the target page we have a section that has the <code>id="interesting-section"</code>. In order to point our link to that section, we&#8217;ll need to add the anchor to the generated link.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Section&quot;, root_path(:anchor =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;interesting-section&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/#interesting-section&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Section</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>Ajax Links with link_to Remote</strong><br/>
  You can add the <code>:remote => true</code> option to the link to tell Rails that you want to handle the link via javascript. This option will automatically send an ajax request (handled via the jQuery UJS adapter).
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= link_to &quot;Ajax&quot;, root_path, :remote =</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx"># =&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">remote</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;true&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">Ajax</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>Opening the link in a new tab or window</strong><br/>
  For a good user experience and because you&#8217;ll want your user not to leave your website if possible, you should make all your external links open in a separate tab or window. You can achieve this by using the <code>target="_blank"</code> html attribute which in Rails speak will look like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

  <strong>POST-ing Using link_to</strong><br/>
  Sending a post request via a link is something that the html cannot do. You can only use it to make <code>GET</code> requests, not <code>POST</code>. That being said, Rails has some magic tricks for you.
</p>




<p>
  By providing the <code>:method => :post</code> option, Rails will create a form and submit it via javascript. Note that you need the <code>jquery-rails</code> gem for this to work, if you don&#8217;t have it, there won&#8217;t be any magic happening and your links will default to a GET request.

  These are some of the more common ways I&#8217;ve used link_to but I&#8217;m sure there are many others. So if you have any other examples I could add to the article.

<p>
  We all have ideas we would like to validate yesterday if possible but of course in reality that rarely happens. The constant lack of developer time makes our wishes become dreams most of which will never see the light of day.
</p>




<p>
  Being able to move fast so that you can put your ideas thru the build/measure/learn loop and iterate all the way to product market fit requires having a solid software foundation that will allow you to achieve fast release cycles.
</p>




<p>
  In this post I will show you how to:<br/>
  1. Speed up the development cycle<br/>
  2. Spend less money on developer time<br/>
  3. Build a more productive team
</p>




<p>
  <strong>We Call It Automated Testing</strong><br/>
  Testing — or automated testing — means you put the machine at work by having it test your application often and making sure everything works as expected. You can imagine someone clicking thru the buttons and links on your website, filling in forms etc. and making sure everything is in good shape.
</p>




<p>
  So by having every corner of your application checked at will and in record time, you will have the confidence that a feature you&#8217;ve previously built will stay functional forever — or at least until you decide to nuke it — by being notified immediately when something stopped working for whatever the reason.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>How Can Testing Help My Business?</strong><br/>
  It&#8217;s less obvious until you&#8217;ve done software development for a while but, the most time spent by developers is not on building new and cool stuff — nor on playing video games. Actually, the most time is spent on fixing bugs (previously built features that somehow got broken in the process of increasing the complexity of your application).
</p>




<p>
  Knowing immediately when things got broken, where and why, means developers will spend a lot less time searching for the source of evil before they can actually do the work involved in fixing the issue — which usually amounts to much less then the digging, staring, guessing and searching process.
</p>




<p>
  So having to spend less and less time on fixing broken features as your app becomes more and more complex translates into improving development speed and cutting costs greatly in the long run.
</p>




<p>
  Automated testing gives you a new power; the confidence of changing existing features and adding ones with minimal overhead.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Let’s Get the Product Managers Involved</strong><br/>
  Another very important aspect of testing is that features need to be described in great detail before the developer’s work can start so in other words, the developer knows exactly what he needs to do in order to deliver the required features to the stakeholders and match their expectations. This is also a good time for the developers to actually see the product from a different perspective.
</p>




<p>
  Instead of going back and forth about what the product manager wanted and what the developer thought he wanted and thus building the wrong feature, more time is spent communicating using a common language, the real expectations and making sure the developer&#8217;s efforts are well spent.
</p>




<p>
  The automated testing language is written in plain english — or any other language of your choosing — and it requires both the product manager and the developer to sit down, think thru each step of every feature and put everything on paper before writing the first line of code.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Planing for the Future</strong><br/>
  In the developer&#8217;s world, technology changes extremely fast and thus new tools or new versions emerge with new and shiny features that your business could benefit from. But there’s one thing that stands in the way of all that goodness and that is… the fear of change. Changing a tool or upgrading one to a newer version increases the chance of breaking existing functionality.
</p>




<p>
  As you might’ve expected, this is another area where testing can save you a ton of time. By having a fully tested application, you can have your cake and eat it too — just get the new stuff, run your tests and see precisely what got broken in the process so you can start fixing. The horrible alternative would be to have your developers and QA team go over each and every feature — that they remember — and manually test it, or even worse, users discovering bugs and probably not telling you about them.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Show Me an Example</strong><br/>
  Let’s see how an automated test might look like in real life.
</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  What you see here is a valid automated test that makes sure that a user can log into your site by opening a browser, clicking on the login link, filling in the sign-in form and making sure that when the log in was successful, the user will be on his dashboard page.
</p>




<p>
  As you can see the test is very readable and thus it can be easily used as a communication tool between the product team — or the stakeholders — and the development team.
</p>




<p>
  So my advice to you is to use testing as much as possible and as early in the development process as you can. It saved me and my business countless hours and I can guarantee it will do the same for yours.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

  I always try to improve my development stack in order to gain productivity. And during the last few months, there has been a lot of change.
</p>




<p>
  Here is my current development stack that I use to create web apps:
</p>




<h3>
  Front-End
</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Bootstrap:</strong> A great HTML/CSS framework. It helps you build MVC very fast. Sass: A language compiled into CSS which adds many features such as variables, imports and functions.<br/>
  <strong>Sass:</strong> A language compiled into CSS which adds many features such as variables, imports and functions.<br/>
  <strong>Jquery:</strong> Good old Jquery, indeed. I may start to use angular in the next few weeks if I have enough time.
</p>




<h3>
  Back-End
</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Ruby on Rails:</strong> The most productive web framework I have ever worked with, much faster than any PHP framework, and enforcing many good software engineering practices.<br/>
  <strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> Faster and most powerful than most RDBMS (including MySQL), and free.
</p>




<h3>
  Hosting
</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Heroku:</strong> A great PaaS, and free for small apps. I also tried Google App Engine but its lack of flexibility was a problem for me.<br/>
  <strong>Cloudflare:</strong> It makes your app load faster and gives you a free SSL certificate.<br/>
  <strong>Mandrill:</strong> Very easy to use, yet powerful, EaaS (Email as a Service). I use it to send transactional emails like welcome messages and password resets.
</p>




<h3>
  Deployment
</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Git:</strong> I configured it with a pre-commit hook which automatically runs rails tests. And thanks to Heroku a simple push deploys my code. It’s very useful and now I just couldn’t go back.
</p>




<h3>
  Monitoring
</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Pingdom:</strong> A great tool to receive alerts if your app goes down (and if you add IFTTT you can receive them by SMS).
</p>




<p>
  Let’s see what it looks like (with the help of a great website I recently found):

<p>
  Ruby on Rails is an open source web application framework built on Ruby. While Rails is 100% free, there is a lot of argument over its effectiveness in comparison with more standard, tried-and-true web applications. Despite its criticism, many big players such as Hulu, Groupon, and Twitter have incorporated its use into their booming platforms, so it is definitely worth at least knowing a little bit more about it.
</p>




<p>
  Like most open-source frameworks, Rails has found a home in the agile community.  This modern approach to software development promotes early deliveries, feedback from the client, and adaptation over the course of the development process. Because of its malleable nature, Ruby on Rails development works well with this approach.
</p>

  Like most open-source frameworks, Rails has found a home in the agile community.  This modern approach to software development  promotes early deliveries, feedback from the client, and adaptation over the course of the development process. Because of its malleable nature, Ruby on Rails development works well with this approach.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Don’t Repeat Yourself</strong><br/>
  Is this code DRY enough? If a code only exists in one place, changing it later will be much easier. Rails is equipped with helpers and libraries to help implement this approach. More concise and efficient code allows changes to be made easily later on in the development cycle, as is the norm in an Agile methodology.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Test-drive Your Code</strong><br/>
  Not only do tests ensure that features work, but they later come in handy when changes are being made to assure everything runs correctly. Starting tests are automatically generated for you in Ruby, which help to ensure that tests are run at every process in development (which, again, is important in Agile development).
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Focus on Convention over Configuration</strong><br/>
  Ruby on Rails comes with conventions to spend less time configuring, such as generators that enable you to setup fast, and a multi-environment setup that is part of the package. Also included are pre-configurations for HTTP servers, meaning changes can be made to the live-site to satisfy the client demands face-to-face. With common web programming tasks out of the way (and more concise and readable), more time can be devoted to catering towards the clients specifications. A project that is easy and fast to modify will work best in an Agile environment.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>4. Be Dynamic</strong><br/>
  Rails is constantly changing and adapting to the tech industry. When other frameworks develop new techniques, Rails is quick to follow through with their ideas. Rails has a thriving online community, consisting of blogs, conferences, IRC channels, and gems, which is the term used for Ruby software packages. All these make it easier to revise and update features for the product so that it is ready for the current environment.
</p>




<p>
  Agile has a strong focus on constant adaption in coordination with the client. Quickness, efficiency, and quality are key factors in implementing development in this method. Ruby on Rails is designed to be fast, simple, and malleable, and because of this has grown to be extremely popular.

</p>




<p>
  Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a compact and effective way to build web applications. Each platform has advantages and disadvantages that make sense in light of each company&#8217;s target market. The main advantages of Ruby on Rails usage are:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. High Speed of Development</strong><br/>
  For example, site development that would traditionally take about 2-3 months can commonly be launched much quicker with Ruby on Rails. This time savings results from a few factors: a leaner code-base (fewer lines of redundant code) and a modular design (re-using existing components rather than building everything from scratch). As such, after launching the site, modifications can be made more quickly as well.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Cost-Effectiveness</strong><br/>
  As Rails sites can be built and modified quickly, this is a really cost-effective way to create and maintain the website — without compromising the quality, performance, or scalability of your site.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Flexibility</strong><br/>
  There are lots of gems (already built components of specific functionality available); re-using them rather than building everything from scratch provides a lot of different bricks to build the application and extend its functionality.A variety of plugins are available to solve just about any functional challenge you may need for your project. Additionally, Rails is an ideal way to build custom database solutions at a fraction of the usual time and expense.

</p>




<p>
  <strong>4. High code quality</strong><br/>
  The Ruby language and Ruby on Rails framework are under active development and support. New features, ideas are introduced quite often. Security updates and fixes are released regularly. A large body of books, blog entries and experiences are also shared online to learn from.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>5. Industry support</strong><br/>
  There are professional hosting support companies, (Heroku, EngineYard). experienced consulting companies, two primary cloud-based offerings, and help with development and deployment and more. Both provide an easy-to-scale, managed hosting environment. Both are built on Amazon EC2 and offer contrasting approaches and features that will appeal to different audiences.

  If you are curious to know which sites are built with Ruby on Rails, then this article is for you. In a previous blog we have mentioned that startups tend to choose Ruby on Rails for a variety of reason. Same reasons reflect here. These 8 following sites use the framework or at least these were built with Ruby on Rails initially.
</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">TWITTER</a></strong><br/>
  Twitter is the most popular micro blogging platform in the world. It was envisioned by Dorsey as the sms of the internet. Twitter was first developed in 2006 with public release in 2007. It was developed in Ruby on Rails. Later it shifted its framework due to scalability. Like we said, startups have some special interest in Ruby on Rails.
</p>

</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">SHOPIFY</a></strong><br/>
  Shopify is SaaS e-commerce platform. Basically, the merchants subscribes and uses Shopify for selling their product online or in store. Shopify was developed by Lütke in Ruby on Rails. He spent two months to develop the e-commerce platform for their snowboarding website. Interestingly, he did it because he was very dissatisfied with the existing platforms. In 2006, Shopify opened up to merchant and began enjoying significant growth.
</p>

</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">GROUPON</a></strong><br/>
  Groupon is a deal of the day platform that issues discounted gift certificate a buy can use at variety of stores. Groupon was initially build with Ruby on Rails. It has enjoyed significant growth and now has 3 billion+ market capitalization. However, its business model has been heavily criticized since it inception. The criticism has been further bolstered by steady decline in sales and the ousting of the Founder-CEO Mr. Andrew D. Mason.
</p>

</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/" target="_blank">BLOOMBERG</a></strong><br/>
  Bloomberg is a private software, data and media company. It currently employs 15000 employees. Bloomberg provides analytical and stock trading platform, data and news services to companies through Bloomberg terminal.
</p>

</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">SOUNDCLOUD</a></strong><br/>
  SoundCloud is a social platform for sound. It is like audio youtube where anybody can upload any sound or tunes and share them publicly or privately. Today, everyone is on multiple social platform. This has added a new dimension to SoundCloud. It is growing everyday and becoming a concern for other paid platform like iTunes and Google Play.
</p>

</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="https://squareup.com/global/en-gb/register" target="_blank">SQUARE</a></strong><br/>
  Square is making commerce easier for both enterprises and consumers. It was co-founded by twitter.com co-founder Dorsey. It makes credit card readers and stands that are attached with phones and tables. Users swap cards through these readers and make purchases.
</p>




<p>

</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GITHUB</a></strong><br/>
  The hub is the social platform for programmers. Git works a repository where coders push codes and conduct review. It is a leading website for code share. If you are a programmer/ developer applying for a job, many times perhaps you have noticed employers asking for your Github username to see your work. Github significantly facilitates the development of web application.

<p>
  Have you ever wonder how the companies that offer free services make money? Such as Instagram, Evernote, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Maps, so on&#8230; or if it is even profitable to keep free users using their services. We would go through several revenue models and hopefully, it will throw you some light next time you decide to roll your own startup.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Revenues Models</strong><br/>
  Let’s start first giving some perspective what models are actually giving the most revenues. In 2013, App Store, reported that free apps brought the 71% of the revenue! Even more than paid apps&#8230; how’s that even possible?
</p>




<p>
  Ok, let’s discuss some revenue models to understand this. There are 8 main models.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Freemium:</strong> apps are free to download and use. However, quite often some different features are sold separately (e.g. new levels, specialized functions, remove ads, more capacity, and so on). E.g. Pandora, Hulu, Google Docs.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Premium:</strong> users paid upfront a fixed price for the application. After you pay for it, you are able to download it. Usually new software updates are free. E.g. MS Office 365.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Subscription:</strong> users paid a fixed price which is automatically charged every certain time. Magazines in the iOS Newsstand are a good example of this subscription based model. Subscriptions have generally lower prices than premium accounts. E.g. Netfix.
</p>




<p>
  Freemium is not as &#8220;free&#8221; as it might seem in the surface, there are indirect ways of getting revenues from it.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Advertising:</strong> the application/service is free to use, but it contains ads or interruption banners for an couple of minutes in order to raise revenue. This model is usually applied along with freemium apps and to remove the ads users have to pay a subscription. E.g. Spotify.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Selling data:</strong> user information and behavior inside the application is sell to interested 3rd-parties. Usually used with freemium apps and specified in the terms of used.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Transaction:</strong> the application is free to use generally and charges a percentage or fixed fee with every users’ transaction made. For example, it allows you to publish your item on their site for free but when you sell it, it charges you a fee. Or publish a project in a site and when it reaches certain goal a percentage fee is applied. E.g. eBay, Kickstarter.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Online lead generation:</strong> collects user’s information sometimes in an exchange of a product or service and then resell the information to companies interested indirectly. It’s different from the selling data model because the information is not sold to 3rd party directly, but indirectly. Influencing users desitions based on 3rd party companies affiliated and users’ interests, likes and behaviors. E.g. Mint, LinkedIn.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Donations:</strong> (it’s self-explanatory) Services/apps are free, but it encourages users to contribute throughout donations to support the development.
</p>




<p>
  After reading these, you might have more clues why free apps are so much win nowadays. They helped to create those million-dollar-per-day games! (remembered FlappyBird, Candycrush, Farmville…) In a market where there is enough competition, having a free option will take you to large numbers of users quicker and broader, because of the low barrier to entry. For instance, Whatsapp had at certain point 10k of daily downloads, after moving it to $1 it download rate drops 10 times, they finally opted for yearly subscriptions.
</p>




<p>
  Subscription-based revenue are also a model worth doing a special mention. It brings a steady flow of income to companies and usually comes in different tiers to fulfill users need. But, it has to be flexible enough, because it might limit hard core users which might be willing to pay more for taking the product to a new level.

  <img src="/images/happy_ruby_on_rails.jpg" width="400" alt="5 Tips to Scale Your Ruby on Rails Application" />
</p>




<p>
  There are lots of resources on the web that explain how to scale web applications and how to scale Rails. Here&#8217;s a quick summary of just five of the basic strategies for a scalable Ruby on Rails web application. Some of them are specific to Ruby on Rails; others generalize to any shared-nothing application server architecture.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Cache, cache, cache and More Cache</strong><br/>
  Cache at the client and use Ajax libraries like JQuery to stream in data to the browser on demand. Use gateway /reverse proxy caches to cache HTTP responses at your website, and learn how to use expiration and etags. Take full advantage of Rails&#8217; built-in action, page and fragment caching. Use memcache to cache results that you&#8217;d otherwise pull from your database.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Segregate Data and Data Serving</strong><br/>
  Don&#8217;t munge all your data storage into a single database &#8220;for convenience.&#8221; Datasets that are independent should go into separate databases. Serve static assets from a separate tier, or use Amazon S3 or a CDN like Akamai to serve those assets. It&#8217;s more expensive, but it simplifies scaling. Relational databases scale up, not out, so sit down and have a heart to heart talk with your DBA over whether you really need a relational data model for all your data stores. Maybe you can get away with a simpler key-value data store for some of your simpler data. There are ruby clients, so use Hadoop for scaling the storage and analysis of large amounts of unstructured data. Also know the scalability limitations of whatever file system you&#8217;re using. If you have heavy data reporting needs, do your reporting from a copy of your main database, not from your production database.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Minimize & Handle External Dependencies</strong><br/>
  Watch for dependencies on external services like ad serving networks or RSS feeds. If a service isn&#8217;t responding or can&#8217;t handle your growing request load, make sure that you have a fallback strategy.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>4. Tend Your Database and Your Job Handlers</strong><br/>
  Any ORM, including Rails&#8217; ActiveRecord can generate SQL queries that cause database performance issues. Make sure you&#8217;re looking at your slow query log after each major integration to make sure you don&#8217;t have &#8220;missing&#8221; database indices, and haven&#8217;t written inappropriate find-all&#8217;s in your Rails code. Scrub your database periodically for indices that are no longer being used. Similarly, watch the resource consumption of your background and scheduled jobs. As your user base grows jobs can start to overlap, and daily log processing can start to take more than 24 hrs! This kind of thing can sneak up on you easily. Ideally, segregate your jobs in a separate tier. And, as you grow, look at moving to a message based job handler.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>5. Shard Your Unavoidably Relational Data</strong><br/>
  At high scaling levels, your MySQL database will have to be sharded. Sharding involves breaking up your datasets into independent pieces based on a key. For many consumer-oriented Rails sites, that can mean sharding based on userid&#8217;s, but other sharding schemes use data-age, or access-frequency (if that&#8217;s predictable).

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  <img src="/images/happy_ruby_on_rails.jpg" width="400" alt="IP Geolocation in Ruby on Rails Application" />
</p>




<p>
  Sometimes it can be useful to find a user&#8217;s physical location in our Rails application. For instance, maybe we want to send a special Happy Holidays to users of a particular country. IP address geolocation lets us do exactly that. With IP address geolocation you can get a pretty good idea of where the customer is accessing your site from as long as they aren&#8217;t using a proxy server or some other means of obscuring their IP address. In this article we will show you how to utilize the Maxmind GeoIP database to look up the location of just about any IP address. Let&#8217;s get started.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Setup Rails Application</strong><br/>
  To utilize the IP address geolocation functionality, we first need to add the geoip gem to our gemfile. Open up your gemfile and add in the code listed below:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;geoip&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;~&gt; 1.4.0&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Great, now let&#8217;s run a bundle install to install the gem.
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">bundle</span> <span class="n">install</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Now we need to download the GeoIP database for use with the geoip gem. A free one <a href="http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz" target="_blank"> can be downloaded at this link</a>, or you can use the paid version if you have a subscription. Once downloaded, extract the compressed archive and place the .dat folder contained within in the root directory of your Rails app.
</p>




<p>
  Great, now let&#8217;s create a controller so that we can play around with the GeoIP functionality. Run the commands below to create a controller called GeoIpRequest:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="n">controller</span> <span class="n">geo_ip_request</span> <span class="kp">new</span> <span class="n">create</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Next, open up your routes file and modify it so that it looks like the code listed below:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/routes.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">application</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">routes</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">draw</span> <span class="k">do</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Great, now open up your GeoIpRequest controller and modify it so that it looks like the code listed below.
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/controllers/geo_ip_request_controller.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">GeoIpRequestController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  In the code above, we tell the geoip gem to load our database file and do a search for the host parameter.
</p>




<p>
  Now let&#8217;s create our views. Open up the new view for the GeoIpRequest controller and modify it so that it looks like the code listed below:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/views/geo_ip_request/new.html.erb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">h1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="no">GeoIP</span> <span class="no">Example</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/h1&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= form_for :request, url: geo_ip_request_index_path do |f| %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;%=</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text_field</span> <span class="ss">:host</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% end </span><span class="o">%&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Great, now finally let&#8217;s do the create view. Open up the create view for the GeoIpRequest controller and modify it so that it looks like the code listed below.
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>app/views/geo_ip_request/create.html.erb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Excellent, now if you fire up your rails development server and and navigate to http://localhost:3000 you will see a form requesting your ip address or hostname. Entering any ip address or host name will show the country, city, and region that ip is from.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, that&#8217;s it!!! that&#8217;s all there is to it!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  You may have noticed that Rails 4 creates a new folder called concerns. Concerns are pieces of code that allow you to better organize the code that you write. This feature has actually been around for a long time prior to Rails 4, Rails 4 merely creates the folders for you and sets up the environment. In this article, we focus primarily on Rails 4.0, but it should apply equally to 3.2.x or even 3.0.x and earlier.
</p>




<p>
  Here is a simple example, lets say we have a model called user. In this model we would typically have something like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create_password_reset_token</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kp">false</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  We can create a a file in the app/models/concerns folder called authentication.rb (app/models/concerns/authentication.rb) and place the following code in it:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Authentication</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="ss">ActiveSupport</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Concern</span>

</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kp">false</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Now, lets refactor the User model to use the new code. Change the users model (app/models/user.rb) so that it looks like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="ss">ActiveRecord</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Base</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Authentication</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Now if you start the rails server and attempt to authenticate, you&#8217;ll notice that the functionality hasn&#8217;t changed at all. That&#8217;s the idea! You can use this method for organizing and DRYing up your code.
</p>




<p>
  The extend <code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code> tells rails that we are creating a concern.
</p>




<p>
  The code contained within the included block will be executed within the context of the class that is including the module. This is perfect for including functionality provided by 3rd party gems, etc.
</p>




<p>
  Next you will notice the <code>module ClassMethods</code> block. The code contained within this block will be added to the Class itself. For example, the code above adds an authenticate function to the User class. This allows you to do User.authenticate(email, password) instead of User.find_by_email(email).authenticate(password).
</p>




<p>
  Finally you will see the last bit of code, the <code>create_password_reset_token</code> function. Code not included in the <code>ClassMethods</code> block or the <code>included</code> block will be included as instance methods. For example, You could do <code>@user = User.find(params[:id])</code> and then do <code>@user.create_password_reset_token</code> to create a password reset token for the specified user.
</p>




<p>
  Now, all of this is great, but what benefit do you get from organizing your code in this fashion? Well, lets look at a good example of how utilizing this functionality of Rails can save you time and make your code much cleaner. Lets say we have a number of different models, BlogPosts, Articles, Comments, etc and we want to add tagging functionality that will allow the user to tag each object as something. Utilizing concerns we can quickly and easily do this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Taggable</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="ss">ActiveSupport</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Concern</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">included</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:taggings</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">as</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:taggable</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">dependent</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:destroy</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:tags</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">through</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:taggings</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">tag_names</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">tags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  In this simple example, you&#8217;ll see that simply including Taggable on your modules will (with the database structure in place of course) make your models taggable. This code can quickly and easily be spread upon as many models as needed. Well that&#8217;s it! Concerns are a great way to keep your code organized and DRY.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That it!!! See ya!!! :)
