<p>
  Freelancer is a self-employed person who pursues a profession without a long-term commitment to any particular employer. Your curiosity in this opportunity was probably sparked by posts marked &#8220;Freelance&#8221; or &#8220;Work from anywhere&#8221; on the myriad of job boards around the Web. Freelancing is equal parts freedom and responsibility. While you have the freedom to choose when you work, where you work and what you work on, you are also responsible for everything: deadlines, finding work, the quality of your work, communication and so much more.
</p>




<p>
  So, your skill may be in Web development, Graphic design and your approach is to freelance, but it’s not that easy: freelancing is no walk in the park. It could become a living nightmare if you’re not able to use your time efficiently and remain focused and motivated until a project comes to a close. It could also become a nightmare if you market yourself poorly, are constantly desperate for work or surrender too much power to a client, putting you in the position of a monkey-worker responding to petty demands. The reasons I love being a freelancer:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Be your own boss</strong><br/>
  Report to no one but yourself. You will work on boring tasks.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Enjoy your freedom</strong><br/>
  You have the freedom to work when and where you please, the freedom to structure your day as you please.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Choose what to work on</strong><br/>
  Want to spend 50% of your time on open-source projects? Interested in building your own Web app? You have the power to make that a reality. Want to work exclusively on projects in social media? Make it happen.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Set your rates</strong><br/>
  Value is both a reflection of how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you. Are you capable of meeting deadlines, communicating well and delivering quality code?
</p>




<p>
  If you are just starting out, charging $80 per hour will be hard; you have to earn that rate over time and with experience.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

<p>
  <strong>WE LIVE IN INTERESTING TIMES.</strong> As development gets distributed across the globe, you learn there are lots of people capable of doing your job. <strong> You need to keep learning to stay marketable.</strong> Otherwise you&#8217;ll become a dinosaur, stuck in the same job until, one day, you&#8217;ll no longer be needed or your job get out-sourced to some cheaper resource.
</p>




<p>
  So what do you do about it? Here&#8217;s a list of ways to keep you learning. Many of these can be found on the Internet for free:
</p>




<p>
  + Read books, magazines, blogs, Twitter feeds, and websites. If you want to go deeper into a subject, consider joining a mailing list or new group.
</p>




<p>
  + If you really want to get immersed in a technology, get hand on&#8211;write some code.
</p>




<p>
  + A good way to learn something is to teach or speak about it. When people are going to listen to you and ask you questions, you&#8217;ll be highly motivated to learn. Try a lunch learn at work, a user group, or a local conference.
</p>




<p>
  + Join or start a study group or a local user group for a languages, technology, or discipline you are interested in.
</p>




<p>
  + Go to conferences. And if you can&#8217;t go, many conferences put their talks on line for free.
</p>




<p>
  + Long commute? Listen to podcasts.
</p>




<p>
  + Follow the advice of the Pragmatic Programmers and learn a new language every year.
</p>




<p>
  + Not everything you learn has to be about technology. Learn the domain you&#8217;re working in so you can better understand the requirements and help solve the business problem. Learning how to be more productive&#8211;how to work better&#8211;is another good option.
</p>




<p>
  + Go back to school.
</p>




<p>
  You don&#8217;t have to spend every waking hour learning. A little time&#8211;say, each week&#8211;is better than nothing. There is (or should be) a life outside of work.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Technology changes fast. Don&#8217;t get left behind.</strong>

</p>




<p>
  I’ve started to wonder if by focusing so much on learning code, we’re losing focus on how to support one of our most important assets in the technology industry.
</p>




<p>
  Technology and languages change constantly, so what was taught in a college coding class a few years ago is now outdated.
</p>




<p>
  This is a big problem, and one that will only become more severe over time. Just think about an iOS developer who in a few years might be coding entirely in Swift , Apple’s newly launched language. This type of rapid change is absent from almost all other industries, yet remains a serious concern for us.
</p>




<p>
  Here are just a few ideas that come to mind:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Encourage pair programming</strong><br/>
  In case you’re not familiar, this is where two programmers work on the same computer at the same time so they can solve problems together. Every programmer has different strengths and weaknesses, so taking time to code together with different people in the company can be a great learning experience.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Make learning free</strong><br/>
  A lot of technology companies offer some pretty awesome benefits, like catered lunches, healthy snacks and gym memberships. Education should be a part of that, too. Give employees budgets to buy educational books, or offer to pay for couple technical conferences a year that they may want to attend. The easier you make it for your team to continue learning, the more likely they are to take advantage of educational resources—and that ultimately helps both them and your company.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Set learning time during work hours</strong><br/>
  Some companies set aside a few hours every week for everyone to stop working and spend time doing something that makes them better. This could be taking a typing class, playing an online programming course, refactoring some old code, or even coding a side project using a new language.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Not one way to learning but many.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  learning is a personal process and different things work for different people. Some people like books, others prefer online videos, and some just like to dig in and experiment. The best way to tackle different learning styles is by having a good mix of tools—and ways for developers to get access to them—so they continue to grow in the way that’s best for them.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Have you successfully implemented an education program for your development team?</strong>

</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Threaten them.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Pay them lots of money.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Make their work/work space fun.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  In today&#8217;s workplace, threatening people has not been effective. Paying them lots of money (even if you can afford it) has only shown short-term success. Only number three, making their workplace enjoyable, has a track record of effecting real change. It is time managers learned how to create an atmosphere that is challenging, creative and fun for employees as well as for themselves.
</p>




<blockquote><p>FUN IS PRODUCTIVE</p></blockquote>




<p>
  Imagine a work world where people love their work environment, and they are calm, stress-free and happy all day long. People who are in good spirits are more likely to be productive. Their mental attitude produces increased oxygen, endorphins, and blood flow to the brain, which enables them to think more clearly and creatively. They are more relaxed, more accepting of others, and more likely to share their sense of humor.
</p>




<p>
  Laughter creates a bond that brings others together; people like to be with employees who are having fun. Creativity, intuition and flexibility are key to successful operation of organizations today. In stimulating environments, employees enjoy their time at work and they will also excel at work. A fun workplace is not only more productive, but it attracts people and profits.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good take it easy&#8230; let create a Fun Workplace&#8230; :)

</p>




<p>
  <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rufus-scheduler/versions/3.2.0" target="_blank">rufus-scheduler</a> is a handy gem that allows you to perform background jobs. In this article we will show you how to use rufus-scheduler in your Rails applications. Let&#8217;s get started:
</p>




<h3>Setup</h3>




<p>
  In order to use rufus-scheduler, we must first add the rufus-scheduler gem to our Gemfile. To do this, open up your Gemfile and add in the line listed below:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rufus-scheduler&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Run a bundle install to install the gem:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">bundle</span> <span class="n">install</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Great, we need to create an initializer that will contain the jobs we wish to schedule. Create a new initializer called scheduler.rb in the <code>config/initializers</code> directory and add in the code listed below:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/scheduler.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rufus-scheduler&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">scheduler</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="ss">Rufus</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="ss">:Scheduler</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">singleton</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># jobs go below here.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Now we are ready to schedule jobs.
</p>




<h3>Scheduling the Jobs</h3>




<p>
  rufus-scheduler provides a simple syntax for scheduling jobs. You can schedule both one time jobs and recurring jobs. One time jobs can be either scheduled at a specific time, or you can tell rufus to wait a specific amount of time before running the job (a delayed job). For recurring jobs and delayed jobs, you can either use a simple plain English (30m = 30 minutes, etc.) format or you can use the cron format for scheduling jobs. For this article we&#8217;ll focus on the English format:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Recurring the Jobs</strong><br/>
  Scheduling recurring jobs is easy. Simply use the following format in your scheduler.rb file:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/scheduler.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">scheduler</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">every</span> <span class="s1">&#39;5s&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># do stuff</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  The code above would perform your background task every 5 seconds. The list below will give you an idea of what time units are supported:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>s</strong> Example: 5s - seconds, specifies the number of seconds you wish to wait.<br/>
  <strong>m</strong> Example: 5m - the number of minutes you wish to wait.<br/>
  <strong>h</strong> Example: 5h - the number of hours you wish to wait.<br/>
  <strong>d</strong> Example: 5d - the number of days you wish to wait.<br/>
  <strong>w</strong> Example: 5w - the number of weeks you wish to wait.<br/>
  <strong>M</strong> Example: 5M - the number of months you wish to wait.<br/>
  <strong>y</strong> Example: 1y - the number of years you wish to wait.
</p>




<p>
  For example, the following code would tell rufus you wish to schedule a job for every 11 and a half hours:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/scheduler.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">scheduler</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">every</span> <span class="s1">&#39;11h30m&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># do stuff</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  Scheduling a delayed job is easy. The syntax is similar to the recurring syntax listed above, but we use the <code>.in</code> method instead of <code>.every</code>. For example, the following code would run a task 4 hours after the server starts:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/scheduler.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">scheduler</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">in</span> <span class="s1">&#39;4h&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># do stuff</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  <strong>Scheduling the Jobs for Specific Dates/Times</strong><br/>
  You can also schedule a job for a specific date and time. To do this we use the at method. For example, the following code would run at 12:01am on December 1st, 2017:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/scheduler.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">scheduler</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">at</span> <span class="s1">&#39;2017/12/01 00:01:00&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1"># do stuff</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<h3>Important Caveats</h3>




<p>
  1. Because rufus-scheduler runs in process, the scheduler will reset if your Rails server gets restarted. This means that the timer for your jobs will get reset, so don&#8217;t count on any monthly or yearly jobs getting called. If you need to persist jobs across server resets, use a job backend. We will show you how to do this in another article.<br/>
  2. Rufus does not work with Active Job.<br/>
  3. Some additional setup is needed for production environments (see below).
</p>




<h3>Production Setup</h3>




<p>
  Production servers require a bit of additional setup. On most production web servers, idle Ruby processes are killed. In order for rufus to work, you&#8217;ll need to stop this from happening. For Passenger/Nginx you can copy the following code below to your <code>nginx.conf</code> config file for your website after the line that says <code>passenger_enabled on;</code>.
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>nginx.conf </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">passenger_spawn_method</span> <span class="n">direct</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">passenger_min_instances</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">passenger_pool_idle_time</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  rufus-scheduler is a simple, easy to use scheduler that provides great functionality. It can be used for stuff like sending emails, cleaning up temp files, and much more.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

<p>
  <strong>1. ZuckNet</strong><br/>
  Mark’s father – Edward Zuckerberg was a dental practitioner, who ran his clinic from the first floor of their home. This made communication between the family members a hassle, because everyone was always running up and down the stairs. To combat with this problem, 11 year old Zuckerberg came up with the idea of an intranet that allowed anyone to login from any computer in the house and send a message. This served as an instant chat system, that was exclusive just to the Zuckerberg family. Randi Zukerberg, Mark’s elder sister, later told People.com how his this was &#8220;the first example of when he started building things-and he never stopped.&#8221;

  Another interesting fact about ZuckNet is that it was quite similar to the very popular AOL instant that into existence, later the same year. To quote Randi again, Mark was &#8216;10 levels ahead&#8217; even at 11.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Synapse Media Player</strong><br/>
</p>




<p>
  <img src="/images/synapse.jpg" width="500" alt="4 Startups Mark Zuckerberg Created Before Facebook" />
</p>




<p>
  In high school, Zuckerberg wrote a computer program that used machine learning to determine a user&#8217;s music listening habits and recommended more music based on the genre, artist, taste, which was pretty much like what Last.fm does today. This app was built in 2000, and was featured by SlashDot and PC magazine back then with an amazing review + a rating of 3 on 5.
</p>




<p>
  Both Microsoft and AOL approached Zuckerberg for buying Synapse + a job offer, but he turned them down and posted the app online for free. He also turned down a full-time employment opportunity at the two corporate giants and went on to enroll at Harvard.
</p>




<p>
  An excerpt from the review: &#8220;This is by far the most innovative media player I have see to date the only function I find it lacking is a more advanced tag editor and the ability to group by Album.&#8221;
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. CourseMatch</strong><br/>
  By the time Zuckerberg started classes at Harvard, he was already known as the, &#8216;Programming prodigy&#8217;. As an early project in his sophomore year, he started CourseMatch, which helped the students at Harvard in picking the courses they want, at the start of every semester. Through CourseMatch, you could see the number of students enrolled in a particular course and a list of all the people who signed up for the same course, allowing you to find out all the courses your class-mates were taking, before making a choice.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>4. FaceMash</strong><br/>
</p>




<p>
  <img src="/images/facemash.jpg" width="500" alt="4 Startups Mark Zuckerberg Created Before Facebook" />
</p>




<p>
  FaceMash is by far the most talked about things that Zuckerberg created as it is said to have initiated the beginning of Facebook. FaceMash presented the user with two pictures of either male or female students at Harvard and asked them to choose the better looking one.
</p>




<p>
  Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg&#8217;s room-mate at Harvard explained that he had built the Website &#8216;just for fun&#8217;.
</p>




<p>
  The Website soon went viral after its launch over the weekend. The traffic was so overwhelming that it lead to the shutting down of one of the Harvard’s network switches making it impossible for a group of students to access the internet.
</p>




<p>
  The site was taken down by Harvard management four hours later, after multiple complaints from students stating that their pictures were used in FaceMash without prior permission.
</p>




<p>
  FaceMash also landed Zuckerberg into trouble.He was brought before the administrative board and was charged with  violation of internet privacy rules and reach of computer security. He was made to publicly apologize, while the student paper wrote articles about how &#8216;inappropriate the whole concept of FaceMash was&#8217;.

</p>




<p>
  Millions of people go to work every day, but they don&#8217;t bring the best parts of themselves to the job&#8211;often because they don&#8217;t know how. They may be stuck in a rut, never quite able to feel they&#8217;re doing truly excellent work.
</p>




<p>
  If you like what you do and you want to take it to the next level, concentrate on these 52 simple things.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Make people feel special:</strong> encourage and empower people at every chance.

<p>
  <strong>3. Focus on the task at hand:</strong> do the best you can where you are with what you have.

<p>
  <strong>4. Treat every task as important:</strong> every job is a self-portrait of the person who does it.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>5. Always do the right thing, even when it&#8217;s hard:</strong> don&#8217;t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can.

</p>




<p>
  <strong>13. Double your income by tripling your knowledge:</strong> don&#8217;t let your knowledge and skills become outdated.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>14. Mind your emotions:</strong> when you&#8217;re angry, count to 10; before you speak, count to 100.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>15. Make small daily improvements for stunning results:</strong> most of the time, success consists of a series of little daily efforts.
</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
  <img src="/images/happy_ruby_on_rails.jpg" width="400" alt="Sessions Expiring" />
</p>




<p>
  To improve user security, we may wish to expire the user&#8217;s session after they are inactive for a given amount of time. In order to do this, we simply set the <code>expire_after</code> parameter when setting up our session store. For example:
</p>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/session_store.rb </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Rails</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">application</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">session_store</span> <span class="ss">:cookie_store</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">key</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;_example_session&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">expire_after</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">minutes</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  The line above would expire the session after 15 minutes of inactivity. This means that the user&#8217;s session variables would get wiped once time reaches 15 minutes since the user last accessed the Rails application. If the user refreshes the page, the timer gets refreshed.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  I had a task to analyse the value of a cookie set by a tool on the subdomain. The value of the cookie set looked something like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;18337|20120404|True#Q0A|18342|21-30|20120404|18344#Q1|18349|NO PARTNER|20120404|18351#Q2|18352|EMPLOYED|20120404|18353#Q4|18432|STRUGGLING|18539|WANT|20120404|18541#Q3|18358|EMPLOYED|20120404|18359#&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  My task was to try to decipher the values of set inside the cookie and how they changed depending on the progress through the application that set the values. I was told the answers to questions sat next to the ID of the question. For example, the answer to the &#8220;age&#8221; question (21-30) was related to the question 18342 and would always appear as |18342|21-30|. I started out with some tests and ended up with a method like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>
  Of course, I wanted to avoid the growing if-else statement so found a way that I could do it dynamically and focus just on the mapping from an ID to an attribute. The resulting code looked like this:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  By the end of the analysis, I discovered that multiple IDs mapped to the same properties and all I had to do was add another entry into the map defining which ID mapped to what property on the object.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That&#8217;s it!!! See ya!!! :)

  If you&#8217;re using Ruby on Rails with Twitter Bootstrap or other css framworks, then you may want to display flash messages with the alert styles. Here is a quick and easy way of doing so.
</p>




<p>
  You just need to quickly extend <code>application_helper.rb</code> with the following:

<p>
  Now when you call a flash message, you can use the following in your view:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% flash.each </span><span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="sx">%&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sx">  &lt;div class=&quot;alert &lt;%= bootstrap_class_for(type) %&gt;</span> <span class="n">alert</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">dismissible</span><span class="s2">&quot; role=&quot;</span><span class="n">alert</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">    &lt;button type=&quot;</span><span class="n">button</span><span class="s2">&quot; class=&quot;</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="s2">&quot; data-dismiss=&quot;</span><span class="n">alert</span><span class="s2">&quot; aria-label=&quot;</span><span class="no">Close</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden=&quot;</span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="s2">&quot;&gt;&amp;times;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">    &lt;%= message %&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">  &lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s2">&lt;% end %&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  And just use:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">flash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:success</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Credit card type saved successfully!&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
  As success message:
</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">flash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:alert</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Alerting you to the monkey on your car!&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>
