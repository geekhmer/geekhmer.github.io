<p>
  This guide is meant to help you acquire the fundamental skills you need to become a Ruby Developer. Using books, video courses, and projects, you’ll learn how to develop web applications using Ruby, HTML & CSS, jQuery, and Rails. Additionally, you will learn about best practices, design patterns and principles, and the fundamentals of visual design. The goal is to build a solid foundation that you can expand on to become an expert Ruby Developer.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Required Reading and Courses</strong><br/>
  1. The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler.<br/>
  2. Online Ruby Course by Pragmatic Studios.<br/>
  3. HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett.<br/>

  <strong>How To Use This Guide</strong><br/>
  The best way to use this guide is to start from the Ruby section and proceed towards the CoffeeScript and jQuery section. Each section has a Core Activity and an Assessment. The core activities are meant to teach you and the assessments are meant for you to practice solving problems on your own. There are additional readings for each section for the purposes of professional development. These readings can be done in-between study sessions or during your commute to work, but don’t skip them.  I encourage you to read the entire guide before you start doing anything. It’s a good idea to know where you will end up before you invest any time.

</p>




<p>
  <strong>Installation</strong><br/>
  To use this extension you need to add meta_request gem to your app's Gemfile:
</p>


<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Gemfile </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:development</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">lsquo</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="n">meta_request</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">rsquo</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>
  Install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/railspanel/gjpfobpafnhjhbajcjgccbbdofdckggg" target="_blank">RailsPanel extension</a> from the Chrome WebStore. This is recommended way of installing extension, since it will auto-update on every new version. Note that you still need to update meta_request gem yourself.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, Let play around with RailsPanel and enjoy your productivity. :)

    <id>http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2014/07/24/vim-the-best-programming-editor-for-unix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  <a class="fancybox" href="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/vim.png"><img src="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/vim.png" width="680" /></a>
</p>




<p>
  Vim is an advanced text editor that provide the power of Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set.
</p>




<p>
  Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.
</p>




<p>
  Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Features</strong><br/>
  - highly configurable.<br/>
  - syntax highlightning.<br/>
  - windows split (both vertically as well as horrizontally).<br/>
  - tabbing.<br/>
  - folding.<br/>
  - unicode support.<br/>
  - flexible indenting.<br/>
  - ...
</p>




<p>
  <strong>The Good</strong><br/>
  Vim is a professional text editor targeting mainly programmers, but it can be also used by any other type of user.<br/>
  It received the best text editor award from readers of the Linux Journal magazine in 2001, 2002, 2003 , 2004 and 2005, which I think tells a lot about its efficiency.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>The Bad</strong><br/>
  The bad and ugly part about Vim would be for most users the fact that they must do the learning first in order to be able to use it.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>The Truth</strong><br/>
  Vim is a multi-platform text editor, Vim provides all the functionality of a regular text editor, such as spell checking, Unicode support, possibility of undo/redo the most recent actions, integrated help but it has also some features of its own which make it a powerful and reliable tool.
</p>
