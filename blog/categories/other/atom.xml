<p>
  If you are curious to know which sites are built with Ruby on Rails, then this article is for you. In a previous blog we have mentioned that startups tend to choose Ruby on Rails for a variety of reason. Same reasons reflect here. These 8 following sites use the framework or at least these were built with Ruby on Rails initially.
</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">TWITTER</a></strong><br/>
  Twitter is the most popular micro blogging platform in the world. It was envisioned by Dorsey as the sms of the internet. Twitter was first developed in 2006 with public release in 2007. It was developed in Ruby on Rails. Later it shifted its framework due to scalability. Like we said, startups have some special interest in Ruby on Rails.
</p>

</p>




<p>
  <strong><a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">SHOPIFY</a></strong><br/>
  Shopify is SaaS e-commerce platform. Basically, the merchants subscribes and uses Shopify for selling their product online or in store. Shopify was developed by Lütke in Ruby on Rails. He spent two months to develop the e-commerce platform for their snowboarding website. Interestingly, he did it because he was very dissatisfied with the existing platforms. In 2006, Shopify opened up to merchant and began enjoying significant growth.

  Groupon is a deal of the day platform that issues discounted gift certificate a buy can use at variety of stores. Groupon was initially build with Ruby on Rails. It has enjoyed significant growth and now has 3 billion+ market capitalization. However, its business model has been heavily criticized since it inception. The criticism has been further bolstered by steady decline in sales and the ousting of the Founder-CEO Mr. Andrew D. Mason.
</p>

<p>
  Have you ever wonder how the companies that offer free services make money? Such as Instagram, Evernote, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Maps, so on... or if it is even profitable to keep free users using their services. We would go through several revenue models and hopefully, it will throw you some light next time you decide to roll your own startup.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Revenues Models</strong><br/>
  Let’s start first giving some perspective what models are actually giving the most revenues. In 2013, App Store, reported that free apps brought the 71% of the revenue! Even more than paid apps... how’s that even possible?
</p>




<p>
  Ok, let’s discuss some revenue models to understand this. There are 8 main models.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Freemium:</strong> apps are free to download and use. However, quite often some different features are sold separately (e.g. new levels, specialized functions, remove ads, more capacity, and so on). E.g. Pandora, Hulu, Google Docs.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Premium:</strong> users paid upfront a fixed price for the application. After you pay for it, you are able to download it. Usually new software updates are free. E.g. MS Office 365.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Subscription:</strong> users paid a fixed price which is automatically charged every certain time. Magazines in the iOS Newsstand are a good example of this subscription based model. Subscriptions have generally lower prices than premium accounts. E.g. Netfix.
</p>




<p>
  Freemium is not as "free" as it might seem in the surface, there are indirect ways of getting revenues from it.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Advertising:</strong> the application/service is free to use, but it contains ads or interruption banners for an couple of minutes in order to raise revenue. This model is usually applied along with freemium apps and to remove the ads users have to pay a subscription. E.g. Spotify.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Selling data:</strong> user information and behavior inside the application is sell to interested 3rd-parties. Usually used with freemium apps and specified in the terms of used.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Transaction:</strong> the application is free to use generally and charges a percentage or fixed fee with every users’ transaction made. For example, it allows you to publish your item on their site for free but when you sell it, it charges you a fee. Or publish a project in a site and when it reaches certain goal a percentage fee is applied. E.g. eBay, Kickstarter.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Online lead generation:</strong> collects user’s information sometimes in an exchange of a product or service and then resell the information to companies interested indirectly. It’s different from the selling data model because the information is not sold to 3rd party directly, but indirectly. Influencing users desitions based on 3rd party companies affiliated and users’ interests, likes and behaviors. E.g. Mint, LinkedIn.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Donations:</strong> (it’s self-explanatory) Services/apps are free, but it encourages users to contribute throughout donations to support the development.
</p>




<p>
  After reading these, you might have more clues why free apps are so much win nowadays. They helped to create those million-dollar-per-day games! (remembered FlappyBird, Candycrush, Farmville…) In a market where there is enough competition, having a free option will take you to large numbers of users quicker and broader, because of the low barrier to entry. For instance, Whatsapp had at certain point 10k of daily downloads, after moving it to $1 it download rate drops 10 times, they finally opted for yearly subscriptions.
</p>




<p>
  Subscription-based revenue are also a model worth doing a special mention. It brings a steady flow of income to companies and usually comes in different tiers to fulfill users need. But, it has to be flexible enough, because it might limit hard core users which might be willing to pay more for taking the product to a new level.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  Using Nginx for your Rails app? Use this trick to speed up your site. If you are using Nginx, you can quickly and easily speed up your site by enabling gzip compression for your application. Gzip compression compresses files and assets before they are sent to the client, resulting in a nice little speed boost. A sample of how to do this is listed below:
</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>
  The gzip types specifies the mime types that will be compressed using the gzip protocol. You can exclude and include other mime types using this particular list. It's best not to include things such as images and/or media files.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

<p>
  Bootstrap is an amazing layout library that is awesome for building both prototypes as well as full blown websites. This very website makes extensive use of Bootstrap 3 to make things look awesome on both mobiles sites as well as the desktop.
</p>




<p>
  What if we want to quickly prototype out a site using bootstrap? Fortunately you can easily add bootstrap to your site without downloading anything, simply reference the associated files on the Yandex CDN. 
</p>




<p>
  Yandex is a worldwide search engine that is extremely popular in russia. Their CDN is extremely fast and has many different libraries available. To add bootstrap via yandex, simply include them like so (this also include jQuery, since Bootstrap JS requires it).

</p>




<p>
  Here's a cool little trick I've found out about the other day. Even though Git is a distributed revision control system, there are times when you need to push to two systems at once. In my case those systems are Github and Heroku. Here is a simple way to do it by modifying your .git/config file.
</p>


<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">core</span><span class="o">]</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">[remote &amp;ldquo;github&amp;rdquo;]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  url = git@github.com:Bunlong/</span><span class="n">rvm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">git</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">fetch</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">+</span><span class="n">refs</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">heads</span><span class="o">/&lt;</span><span class="n">em</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="ss">:refs</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">remotes</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">github</span><span class="o">/&lt;</span><span class="sr">/em&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">[remote &amp;ldquo;origin&amp;rdquo;]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  url = git@heroku.com:pgsearch.git</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sr">  url = git@github.com:Bunlong/</span><span class="n">rvm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">git</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>
  The "heroku" and "github" remotes are generated by git and are created in the setup instructional steps of each service respectively. I went ahead and manually added the remote "origin" and just copied the url variable from the other remotes. You'll now be able to push to both by calling "git push origin" and then you can fetch from each one as individually needed.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)
