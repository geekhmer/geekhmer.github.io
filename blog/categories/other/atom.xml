</p>




<p>
  Nginx and apache are powerful and effective servers by nowadays. Apache currently reigns as the number 1 server for websites and since its public release in 2006. And nginx has taken the world by storm and is now the number 2 server for active sites. 
</p>




<h3>The Reason Why I Use Nginx and Apache Together is</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Nginx</strong><br/>
  - nginx serves static files (images, css, html etc.) really fast and efficient and passes php and .htaccess requests to apache for processing.<br/>
  - nginx needs the help of php-fpm or similar modules for dynamic content.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Apache</strong><br/>
  - apache is hard on server memory.<br/>
  - apache serves php and .htaccess (most cms site like wordpress needs it for rewrite) and if you throw in a php opcode cache like zend opcache or xcache it should serve php even faster.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>nginx + apache with php opcache = performance and server resource efficiency</strong>
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, in the next article I will show you the configurations. That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

  <img src="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/the_freelancer.jpg" width="600" alt="The Freelancer" />
</p>




<p>
  Freelancer is a self-employed person who pursues a profession without a long-term commitment to any particular employer. Your curiosity in this opportunity was probably sparked by posts marked "Freelance" or "Work from anywhere" on the myriad of job boards around the Web. Freelancing is equal parts freedom and responsibility. While you have the freedom to choose when you work, where you work and what you work on, you are also responsible for everything: deadlines, finding work, the quality of your work, communication and so much more.
</p>




<p>
  So, your skill may be in Web development, Graphic design and your approach is to freelance, but it’s not that easy: freelancing is no walk in the park. It could become a living nightmare if you’re not able to use your time efficiently and remain focused and motivated until a project comes to a close. It could also become a nightmare if you market yourself poorly, are constantly desperate for work or surrender too much power to a client, putting you in the position of a monkey-worker responding to petty demands. The reasons I love being a freelancer:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Be your own boss</strong><br/>
  Report to no one but yourself. You will work on boring tasks.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Enjoy your freedom</strong><br/>
  You have the freedom to work when and where you please, the freedom to structure your day as you please.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Choose what to work on</strong><br/>
  Want to spend 50% of your time on open-source projects? Interested in building your own Web app? You have the power to make that a reality. Want to work exclusively on projects in social media? Make it happen.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Set your rates</strong><br/>
  Value is both a reflection of how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you. Are you capable of meeting deadlines, communicating well and delivering quality code?
</p>




<p>
  If you are just starting out, charging $80 per hour will be hard; you have to earn that rate over time and with experience.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

    <link href="http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2016/03/21/continuous-learning/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-21T14:15:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2016/03/21/continuous-learning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  <img src="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/continuous_learning.jpg" width="600" alt="Continuous Learning" />
</p>




<p>
  <strong>WE LIVE IN INTERESTING TIMES.</strong> As development gets distributed across the globe, you learn there are lots of people capable of doing your job. <strong> You need to keep learning to stay marketable.</strong> Otherwise you'll become a dinosaur, stuck in the same job until, one day, you'll no longer be needed or your job get out-sourced to some cheaper resource.
</p>




<p>
  So what do you do about it? Here's a list of ways to keep you learning. Many of these can be found on the Internet for free:
</p>




<p>
  + Read books, magazines, blogs, Twitter feeds, and websites. If you want to go deeper into a subject, consider joining a mailing list or new group.
</p>




<p>
  + If you really want to get immersed in a technology, get hand on--write some code.
</p>




<p>
  + A good way to learn something is to teach or speak about it. When people are going to listen to you and ask you questions, you'll be highly motivated to learn. Try a lunch learn at work, a user group, or a local conference.
</p>




<p>
  + Join or start a study group or a local user group for a languages, technology, or discipline you are interested in.
</p>




<p>
  + Go to conferences. And if you can't go, many conferences put their talks on line for free.
</p>




<p>
  + Long commute? Listen to podcasts.
</p>




<p>
  + Follow the advice of the Pragmatic Programmers and learn a new language every year.
</p>




<p>
  + Not everything you learn has to be about technology. Learn the domain you're working in so you can better understand the requirements and help solve the business problem. Learning how to be more productive--how to work better--is another good option.
</p>




<p>
  + Go back to school.
</p>




<p>
  You don't have to spend every waking hour learning. A little time--say, each week--is better than nothing. There is (or should be) a life outside of work.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Technology changes fast. Don't get left behind.</strong>

    <link href="http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2016/03/14/the-learn-to-code-movement/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-14T15:49:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2016/03/14/the-learn-to-code-movement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  <img src="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/the_learn_to_code_movement.jpg" width="600" alt="The Learn To Code Movement" />
</p>




<p>
  I’ve started to wonder if by focusing so much on learning code, we’re losing focus on how to support one of our most important assets in the technology industry.
</p>




<p>
  Technology and languages change constantly, so what was taught in a college coding class a few years ago is now outdated.
</p>




<p>
  This is a big problem, and one that will only become more severe over time. Just think about an iOS developer who in a few years might be coding entirely in Swift , Apple’s newly launched language. This type of rapid change is absent from almost all other industries, yet remains a serious concern for us.
</p>




<p>
  Here are just a few ideas that come to mind:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Encourage pair programming</strong><br/>
  In case you’re not familiar, this is where two programmers work on the same computer at the same time so they can solve problems together. Every programmer has different strengths and weaknesses, so taking time to code together with different people in the company can be a great learning experience.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Make learning free</strong><br/>
  A lot of technology companies offer some pretty awesome benefits, like catered lunches, healthy snacks and gym memberships. Education should be a part of that, too. Give employees budgets to buy educational books, or offer to pay for couple technical conferences a year that they may want to attend. The easier you make it for your team to continue learning, the more likely they are to take advantage of educational resources—and that ultimately helps both them and your company.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Set learning time during work hours</strong><br/>
  Some companies set aside a few hours every week for everyone to stop working and spend time doing something that makes them better. This could be taking a typing class, playing an online programming course, refactoring some old code, or even coding a side project using a new language.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Not one way to learning but many.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  learning is a personal process and different things work for different people. Some people like books, others prefer online videos, and some just like to dig in and experiment. The best way to tackle different learning styles is by having a good mix of tools—and ways for developers to get access to them—so they continue to grow in the way that’s best for them.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Have you successfully implemented an education program for your development team?</strong>
