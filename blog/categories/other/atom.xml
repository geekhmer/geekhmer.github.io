</p>




<p>
  Using Nginx for your Rails app? Use this trick to speed up your site. If you are using Nginx, you can quickly and easily speed up your site by enabling gzip compression for your application. Gzip compression compresses files and assets before they are sent to the client, resulting in a nice little speed boost. A sample of how to do this is listed below:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock nginx.conf lang:ruby %}
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name mysite.com www.mysite.com;
  root /opt/mysite.com/current/public;
  passenger_enabled on;
  gzip on;
  gzip_http_version 1.1;
  gzip_vary on;
  gzip_comp_level 6;
  gzip_proxied any;
  gzip_types text/plain text/html text/css application/json application/javascript application/x-javascript text/javascript text/xml application/xml application/rss+xml application/atom+xml application/rdf+xml;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  The gzip types specifies the mime types that will be compressed using the gzip protocol. You can exclude and include other mime types using this particular list. It's best not to include things such as images and/or media files.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  Bootstrap is an amazing layout library that is awesome for building both prototypes as well as full blown websites. This very website makes extensive use of Bootstrap 3 to make things look awesome on both mobiles sites as well as the desktop.
</p>




<p>
  What if we want to quickly prototype out a site using bootstrap? Fortunately you can easily add bootstrap to your site without downloading anything, simply reference the associated files on the Yandex CDN. 
</p>




<p>
  Yandex is a worldwide search engine that is extremely popular in russia. Their CDN is extremely fast and has many different libraries available. To add bootstrap via yandex, simply include them like so (this also include jQuery, since Bootstrap JS requires it).
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:javascript %}</p>

<script src="http://yandex.st/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>


<p><link href="http://yandex.st/bootstrap/3.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" /></p>

<script src="http://yandex.st/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>


<p>{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  A full list of the libraries available can be found on the <a href="https://tech.yandex.ru/jslibs/" target="_blank">yandex</a> website. Note that it's in russian, so you might need to translate it.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  Here's a cool little trick I've found out about the other day. Even though Git is a distributed revision control system, there are times when you need to push to two systems at once. In my case those systems are Github and Heroku. Here is a simple way to do it by modifying your .git/config file.
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
[core]
  repositoryformatversion = 0
  filemode = true
  bare = false
  logallrefupdates = true
[remote &ldquo;heroku&rdquo;]
  url = git@heroku.com:pgsearch.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/<em>:refs/remotes/heroku/</em>
[remote &ldquo;github&rdquo;]
  url = git@github.com:Bunlong/rvm.git
  fetch = +refs/heads/<em>:refs/remotes/github/</em>
[remote &ldquo;origin&rdquo;]
  url = git@heroku.com:pgsearch.git
  url = git@github.com:Bunlong/rvm.git
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  The "heroku" and "github" remotes are generated by git and are created in the setup instructional steps of each service respectively. I went ahead and manually added the remote "origin" and just copied the url variable from the other remotes. You'll now be able to push to both by calling "git push origin" and then you can fetch from each one as individually needed.
</p>

  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  Ruby on rails is one of the popular development frameworks for regular websites as well as kind of tools, web and mobile apps or combinations of all. Some of the following reasons which makes it popular among others:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Higher Flexibility</strong> - In Ruby on Rails, it is easy to mold the platform to suit different business needs more efficiently than other frameworks. We can quickly mock up a working prototype, and then see how things work and then build on the idea. Faster Development Speed - In Rails, there are lots of in-built components(called gems) available which we can re-use to build the application rather than building everything from scratch.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Agile Development at its best</strong> - Ruby on Rails is developed using the MVC design pattern along with the agile methodology which is well suited for web application development with fast changing requirements.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Integrated testing tools</strong> - Rails features a convenient testing tool as it automatically starts producing the skeleton test code in background at the time of development. Rails tests can also simulate browser requests and thus you can test your application's response without having to test it over browser.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Compatibility</strong> - Rails development is compatible with a wide range of web servers and databases; which ultimately makes the web deployment easier.Cost-effective Web solutions - As it is an open source framework this helps in developing cost-effective web applications without sacrificing performance, speed and quality.

<p>
  Ruby on Rails is an innovation in development framework. It encompasses all the necessary elements to boost a web application’s performance. This framework is designed to address agile development and deliver productivity as well as flexibility to Ruby on Rails developers. Developed using Ruby programming language, it has transformed the world of web development through its practical approach.
</p>




<h3>Ruby on Rails is built upon two programming philosophies</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Convention over Configuration:</strong>
  Developers only need to write codes for the irregular or unconventional aspects of the web application.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself:</strong>
  The data is stored in definite place. It saves time and reduces code.
</p>




<h3>Advantages of Ruby on Rails</h3>




<p>
  <strong>Faster Development:</strong>
  Rails framework enables the developers to write concise and clear syntax and produces fewer codes than its competitors. Therefore it requires less time to code and generates fewer errors. On the other hand it facilitates the programmers to maintain much less code. It is also enabled to integrate numerous tools to automate repetitive tasks such as managing database errors, creating forms etc... it simplifies development process because the language is lightweight and easily readable, almost like the natural language.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Increases Productivity:</strong>
  Rails framework is specifically featured to reduce the development aspects of applications, instead leveraging creativity and uniqueness of the web application. It empowers productivity by eliminating repetitive programming codes.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Assists Development of Creative Interfaces:</strong>
  Rails includes numerous integrations to enable developers in creating rich, intriguing user interfaces. Integrated JavaScript framework is easier to activate and features elements like apparition progressive, drag & drop and many more to ease the designing aspects of the application.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Model View Controller Design Pattern:</strong>
   Rails is developed on MVC architecture that separates the development logics from the presentation layer. It provides a well-structured application to the developers and the code is maintained in a logical and coherent manner.  It encourages abstraction in the application and enables the team to work on separate modules without depending on each other. It focuses on the features rather than minute details. Rails framework delivers ease of project development, conciseness and faster deployment of application.
</p>




<p>
  Rails Development makes web app development easier because it involves less coding while implementing new changes and updates into the development process. It enables the organizations to meet all the business requirements within the budget and schedule. So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)
