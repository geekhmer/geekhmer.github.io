</p>




<p>
  I’ve started to wonder if by focusing so much on learning code, we’re losing focus on how to support one of our most important assets in the technology industry.
</p>




<p>
  Technology and languages change constantly, so what was taught in a college coding class a few years ago is now outdated.
</p>




<p>
  This is a big problem, and one that will only become more severe over time. Just think about an iOS developer who in a few years might be coding entirely in Swift , Apple’s newly launched language. This type of rapid change is absent from almost all other industries, yet remains a serious concern for us.
</p>




<p>
  Here are just a few ideas that come to mind:
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Encourage pair programming</strong><br/>
  In case you’re not familiar, this is where two programmers work on the same computer at the same time so they can solve problems together. Every programmer has different strengths and weaknesses, so taking time to code together with different people in the company can be a great learning experience.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Make learning free</strong><br/>
  A lot of technology companies offer some pretty awesome benefits, like catered lunches, healthy snacks and gym memberships. Education should be a part of that, too. Give employees budgets to buy educational books, or offer to pay for couple technical conferences a year that they may want to attend. The easier you make it for your team to continue learning, the more likely they are to take advantage of educational resources—and that ultimately helps both them and your company.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Set learning time during work hours</strong><br/>
  Some companies set aside a few hours every week for everyone to stop working and spend time doing something that makes them better. This could be taking a typing class, playing an online programming course, refactoring some old code, or even coding a side project using a new language.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Not one way to learning but many.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  learning is a personal process and different things work for different people. Some people like books, others prefer online videos, and some just like to dig in and experiment. The best way to tackle different learning styles is by having a good mix of tools—and ways for developers to get access to them—so they continue to grow in the way that’s best for them.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Have you successfully implemented an education program for your development team?</strong>

</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Threaten them.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Pay them lots of money.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Make their work/work space fun.</strong>
</p>




<p>
  In today's workplace, threatening people has not been effective. Paying them lots of money (even if you can afford it) has only shown short-term success. Only number three, making their workplace enjoyable, has a track record of effecting real change. It is time managers learned how to create an atmosphere that is challenging, creative and fun for employees as well as for themselves.
</p>


<p><blockquote><p>FUN IS PRODUCTIVE</p></blockquote></p>

<p>
  Imagine a work world where people love their work environment, and they are calm, stress-free and happy all day long. People who are in good spirits are more likely to be productive. Their mental attitude produces increased oxygen, endorphins, and blood flow to the brain, which enables them to think more clearly and creatively. They are more relaxed, more accepting of others, and more likely to share their sense of humor.
</p>




<p>
  Laughter creates a bond that brings others together; people like to be with employees who are having fun. Creativity, intuition and flexibility are key to successful operation of organizations today. In stimulating environments, employees enjoy their time at work and they will also excel at work. A fun workplace is not only more productive, but it attracts people and profits.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good take it easy... let create a Fun Workplace... :)

</p>




<p>
  Millions of people go to work every day, but they don't bring the best parts of themselves to the job--often because they don't know how. They may be stuck in a rut, never quite able to feel they're doing truly excellent work.
</p>




<p>
  If you like what you do and you want to take it to the next level, concentrate on these 52 simple things.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>1. Make people feel special:</strong> encourage and empower people at every chance.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>2. Find work you love and put your heart and soul into it:</strong> choose a job you love and you will never have to work another day in your life.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>3. Focus on the task at hand:</strong> do the best you can where you are with what you have.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>4. Treat every task as important:</strong> every job is a self-portrait of the person who does it.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>5. Always do the right thing, even when it's hard:</strong> don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>6. Delegate whenever you can:</strong> you get the best out of people when you believe in their talent.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>7. Take initiative:</strong> even if you're already very good at your job, do whatever you can to push your limits.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>8. Be part of the solution:</strong> don't be known as someone who is always complaining about something.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>9. Tell the truth:</strong> let people know they can count on you to be honest even when it creates difficulties.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>10. Help as many people as you can along the way:</strong> become someone people seek out for assistance.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>11. Avoid gossip always:</strong> it should go without saying, but turn a deaf ear to gossip and rumors.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>12. Maintain a positive attitude:</strong> a positive attitude is always contagious.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>13. Double your income by tripling your knowledge:</strong> don't let your knowledge and skills become outdated.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>14. Mind your emotions:</strong> when you're angry, count to 10; before you speak, count to 100.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>15. Make small daily improvements for stunning results:</strong> most of the time, success consists of a series of little daily efforts.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>16. Sharpen your skills and focus on mastering your talents:</strong> avoid boredom--and learn a new skill to keep you on top of your game.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>17. Be masterful at what you do despite the obstacles:</strong> no person fails who does their best.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>18. Don't feed your fears:</strong> have faith that you will make it through.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>19. Always be prepared:</strong> success occurs when opportunity meets preparation.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>20. Ask for help when you need it:</strong> there is no such thing as a self-made person; you will reach your goals only with the help of others.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>21. Set goals and get results:</strong> it's important to know where you are going, how you will get there, and what the outcome will be.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>22. Be all that you can be:</strong> don't settle for less than your highest potential.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>23. Don't worry about getting credit for getting things done:</strong> you can accomplish almost anything if you don't worry about who gets the credit.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>24. Preserve your integrity:</strong> make daily choices that are consistent with your values.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>25. Be a good role model:</strong> live by your values and walk your talk.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>26. Don't accept "good enough":</strong> do everything with excellence.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>27. Persevere with persistence:</strong> success is largely a matter of hanging on long after others have let go.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>28. Consider leadership something that exists wherever you are:</strong> make the most of yourself in every situation.
</p>




<p>

<p>
  With all the hate, all the times I’ve been called a spammer, scammer, deceptive, and just about every other negative thing you can imagine, it would be easy for me to quit. So what keeps me going?
</p>




<p>
  It’s true. I get a lot of very negative feedback on the things I do.
</p>




<p>
  It hurts. It sucks. It makes me want to quit. But I keep going anyways. Because every now and then, I get an email from guys in USA... an email that gives me fuel for the fire that I’ve started... an email that makes me believe that what I am doing is important – not for me, not because I have anything special or unique, but because my mundane and ordinary problems and solutions are the same mundane and ordinary problems that other people need to solve. And sometimes, the impact of my solutions are far beyond anything that I ever expected.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>That One Moment Of Impact</strong><br/>
  So why do I keep going? It’s that one positive note... that tweet from some random person... that person who takes the time to reply to an email and let me know that I’ve made an impact... this is why I do what I do.

</p>




<p>
  If you’ve ever written a line of Ruby, you’ve been impacted by the work of Jim Weirich: developer, teacher, mentor, speaker. By all accounts, he was a great person. Was… Sadly, Jim died recently.
</p>




<p>
  I didn’t know Jim, personally. In fact I only recently met him in person for the first time at Reddot ruby conf 2014 in Singapor. I had the pleasure of meeting him very briefly, introducing myself. It was great to finally say "hi" to him, though. I learned a lot from his talks and I still use his ideas of "protocols" instead of "interfaces" in dynamic languages like Ruby and JavaScript. But I’m not going to go in to some lengthy soliloquy about Jim’s life and impact on me.
</p>




<p>
  What really struck me about Jim’s passing was not the impact he had on me, personally, but the impact that he had on a very large number of developers around the world. For a few days after his death, I saw a countless number of tweets and retweets about how Jim had touched people’s lives. I saw stories of how he had changed people’s perspectives on code, on mentoring, and all other aspects of software development. One tweet in particular stuck out, talking about how Jim’s knowledge and wisdom had made this person realize their own inadequacies and how Jim was the only person they had ever met who had been gracious enough to apologize for that.
</p>




<p>
  All of these tweets, the thousands of comments posted on Jim’s last commit in Github, that software development companies around the world paid tribute to him via their public websites – the stories, the lives touched – all of this has me wondering: what will they say of me, when I’m gone? And what will they say about you? Will you have made an impact on the lives of other developers? Will you have shared your knowledge, sought opportunities to teach, entertain and enrich the lives of others?
</p>




<p>
  What impact have you had on the lives of others? What will they say about you, when you’re gone?
</p>
