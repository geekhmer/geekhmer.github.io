</p>




<p>
  Since we setup Ubuntu for our development environment, we also want to use it in production. This keeps your application running consistently between development and production. 
</p>




<h3>Install Ruby</h3>




<p>
  The first step is to install some dependencies for Ruby:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-software-properties libffi-dev
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  Next we're going to be installing Ruby using rvm:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison libffi-dev
gpg &mdash;keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net &mdash;recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3
curl -sSL <a href="https://get.rvm.io">https://get.rvm.io</a> | bash -s stable
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
rvm install 2.3.1
rvm use 2.3.1 &mdash;default
ruby -v
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  The last step is to install Bundler
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
gem install bundler
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<h3>Install Nginx</h3>




<p>
  Phusion is the company that develops Passenger and they recently put out an official Ubuntu package that ships with Nginx and Passenger pre-installed.
</p>




<p>
  We'll be using that to setup our production server because it's very easy to setup:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo apt-key adv &mdash;keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 &mdash;recv-keys 561F9B9CAC40B2F7
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates</p>

<h1>Add Passenger APT repository</h1>

<p>sudo sh -c &lsquo;echo deb <a href="https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/apt/passenger">https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/apt/passenger</a> xenial main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list&rsquo;
sudo apt-get update</p>

<h1>Install Passenger &amp; Nginx</h1>

<p>sudo apt-get install -y nginx-extras passenger
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>So now we have Nginx and passenger installed. We can manage the Nginx webserver by using the service command:</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo service nginx start
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
The service command also provides some other methods such as <code>restart</code> and <code>stop</code> that allow you to easily restart and stop your webserver.
</p>




<p>Next, we need to update the Nginx configuration to point Passenger to the version of Ruby that we're using. You'll want to open up <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> in your favorite editor. I like to use vim, so I'd run this command:</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Find the following lines, and uncomment them:</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}</p>

<h1>#</h1>

<h1>Phusion Passenger config</h1>

<h1>#</h1>

<h1>Uncomment it if you installed passenger or passenger-enterprise</h1>

<h1>#</h1>

<p>include /etc/nginx/passenger.conf;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Once you've configured <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code> , you can run <code>sudo service nginx restart</code> to restart Nginx with the new Passenger configuration.</p>




<h3>Install MySQL and PostgreSQL</h3>




<p>Setting up your production database is pretty easy. Make sure to keep in mind that you should use a different password for your production databases.</p>




<p>Depending on what database you want to use, follow the steps related to the database:</p>




<p>
  <strong>Install MySQL</strong><br/>
  All you need to do in order to install MySQL is to run the following command:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client libmysqlclient-dev
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>You can use the root user and password set during installation for your database or you can add a new user to MySQL.</p>




<p>
  <strong>Install PostgreSQL</strong><br/>
  We can install PostgreSQL like so:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Next we need to setup the postgres user:</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
sudo su &ndash; postgres
createuser &mdash;pwprompt
exit
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>The password you type in here will be the one to put in your <code>my_app/current/config/database.yml</code> later when you deploy your app for the first time.</p>




<h3>Adding The Nginx Host</h3>




<p>In order to get Nginx to respond with the Rails app, we need to modify it's sites-enabled.</p>




<p>Open up <code>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default</code> in your text editor and we will replace the file's contents with the following:</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;</p>

<p>  server_name mydomain.com;
  passenger_enabled on;
  rails_env    production;
  root         /home/deploy/myapp/public;</p>

<p>  # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
  error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
  location = /50x.html {</p>

<pre><code>root   html;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>This is our Nginx configuration for a server listening on port 80. You need to change the server_name values to match the domain you want to use and in root replace "myapp" with the name of your application.</p>




<h3>Connect The Database</h3>




<p>
  The file <code>config/database.yml</code> needs to be updated for the production database server username, password, and host. You can set host to "localhost" and you will have to create a database on the server with the same name by using command:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Then run command below to minify or compress JavaScript and CSS assets:</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<h3>Setup Secret Key Base</h3>




<p>Go to your rails app directory and run command below to generate secret key base:</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
rake secret RAILS_ENV=production
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  Go to <code>/yourapp/config/secrets.yml</code> and set production secret_key_base. Then reload Nginx using command line: <code>sudo service nginx reload</code>
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

</p>




<p>
  I had a task to analyse the value of a cookie set by a tool on the subdomain. The value of the cookie set looked something like this:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
&ldquo;18337|20120404|True#Q0A|18342|21-30|20120404|18344#Q1|18349|NO PARTNER|20120404|18351#Q2|18352|EMPLOYED|20120404|18353#Q4|18432|STRUGGLING|18539|WANT|20120404|18541#Q3|18358|EMPLOYED|20120404|18359#&rdquo;
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  My task was to try to decipher the values of set inside the cookie and how they changed depending on the progress through the application that set the values. I was told the answers to questions sat next to the ID of the question. For example, the answer to the "age" question (21-30) was related to the question 18342 and would always appear as |18342|21-30|. I started out with some tests and ended up with a method like this:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
class Answers
  attr_accessor :age, :employment_status, :has_partner</p>

<p>  def parse(cookie_contents)</p>

<pre><code>items = cookie_contents.split("|")
items.each_index do | i |
   current = items[i]
   if (current == "18342")
     @age = items[i+1]
   elsif (current == "18352")
     @employment_status = items[i+1]
   elsif (current == "18349")
     @current_partner = items[i+1]
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  Of course, I wanted to avoid the growing if-else statement so found a way that I could do it dynamically and focus just on the mapping from an ID to an attribute. The resulting code looked like this:
</p>


<p>{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
class Answers
  attr_accessor :age, :employment_status, :has_partner</p>

<p>  Mappings = {</p>

<pre><code>"18342" =&gt; :age=,
"18352" =&gt; :employment_status=,
"18349" =&gt; :has_partner=
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  def parse(cookie_contents)</p>

<pre><code>items = cookie_contents.split("|")
items.each_index do | i |
   current = items[i]
   if (Mappings.has_key?(current))
      self.public_send(Mappings[current], items[i+1])
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>
  By the end of the analysis, I discovered that multiple IDs mapped to the same properties and all I had to do was add another entry into the map defining which ID mapped to what property on the object.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

    <link href="http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2016/01/23/rails-5-actioncable-architecture-and-concepts/"/>
    <updated>2016-01-23T00:23:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2016/01/23/rails-5-actioncable-architecture-and-concepts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  <img src="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/rail_5_beta_1.jpg" width="600" alt="Rails 5 ActionCable Architecture and Concepts" />
</p>




<p>
  ActionCable is an component of Ruby on Rails 5.0 - it is the first "official" solution for integrating websocket communication with Rails. 
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Websocket Concepts</strong><br/>
  The basic protocol that is pervasive in browser server interaction is HTTP. This is the protocol that gets used when a browser asks for an HTML page, JavaScript or CSS assets.
</p>




<p>
  An HTTP connection is typically short-lived, initiated by the browser and ends when the application server has returned a response. This poses a problem given an event that browsers need to know about, but have not asked for - the server has no way to send data to the browser unasked.
</p>




<p>
  Before websockets, developers have opted for polling loops or long-running http requests (ActionController::Live) to solve such cases, both of which have their own technical difficulties.
</p>




<p>
  Websockets enable browsers and application servers to keep an open connection, enabling both parties to initiate sending data to each other. Given a websocket connection, a server will send an event message to the browser through an open websocket connection, enabling direct interaction between events on a server and the browser.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>ActionCable Architecture and Concepts</strong><br/>
  Traditionally, the websocket way of handling connections did not integrate well into a Rails application - the process of handling a request in Rails is fundamentally aligned with the request-response-end way HTTP connections are handled.
</p>




<p>
  As such, ActionCable does not hook into the typical Rails MVC handling of requests, but adds another entry point to a Rails application - the ActionCable server: This server is, as of now, started as a different process dedicated to handling multiple open websocket connections while loading all components of the Rails application and providing developers the comfort of using its components. The Rails server will propagate messages to the ActionCable server by pushing them to a queue that the ActionCable server is listening to. In the current implementation, this role is given to a Redis instance.
</p>




<p>
  We can explore the architecture and the way communication works between the components using the example of a chat application: It allows multiple users to connect to it and send messages to each other. Users receive messages from other users immediately i.e. users will not need to refresh the browser to see a new message but see it pop up at the end of the message list. You know, a chat like you would expect.
</p>




<p>
  Let's trace one possible way of propagation of a user’s message:<br/>
  - A user opens the page in his browser which in turn opens a websocket connection to the ActionCable server (Websocket).<br/>
  - A user sends the message by remote form submission to the Rails server (HTTP).<br/>
  - The Rails server persists the message and publishes a message including the user and the message body to the queue. It sends an acknowledgement to the user. This ends the HTTP request.<br/>
  - The ActionCable server receives the published message from the queue. It publishes the user and message body to all relevant open websocket connections.<br/>
  - All relevant browsers connected to the ActionCable server receive the message and show it in the DOM.
</p>




<p>
  <img src="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/rails_5_actioncable_concepts.png" width="600" alt="Rails 5 ActionCable Architecture and Concepts" />
</p>




<p>
  To allow for differentiation between different groups of users, ActionCable uses the concept of channels: A user may subscribe to a select few of all available channels and thus only receive messages meant for the given channels. If the chat application were to have multiple "rooms", a user could subscribe to each room via a designated channel.
</p>




<p>
  On the technical side, ActionCable uses EventMachine to handle connections and spawns a new Ruby thread for handling messages. This means that an ActionCable server will need to be multi-threaded.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

    <link href="http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/10-tips-to-speed-up-rails-on-the-front/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-26T22:12:00+07:00</updated>
    <id>http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2015/10/26/10-tips-to-speed-up-rails-on-the-front</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  <img src="http://geekhmer.github.io/images/rails_artwork.jpg" alt="10 Tips to Speed Up Rails on the Front" />
</p>




<p>
  Is your Rails website performing poorly? Are clients and users complaining about 5-10 second pageloads, timeouts on mobile devices, or images that take forever to display? In some cases the solution lies on the backend — caching requests, speeding up DB queries, etc — but often, there are front-end optimizations you can look at first, that could have a huge effect on how fast a site feels. 
</p>




<p>
  <h3>Evaluating front-end Performance</h3>
  Check out <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/" target="_blank">www.webpagetest.org</a>. For a quick glance at your site, look at the grades in the top right for immediate problems, and also check the two "Speed Index" measurements for first and repeat views. Since webpagetest saves all your tests, you can re-run after making some changes to easily see what's improved.
</p>




<p>
  <h3>Avoiding Premature Optimization</h3>
  Performance optimization takes time and resources, both of which are often in short supply. It’s hard to find the point where optimizations start to cost more than they save, and every site and team have their own unique challenges. I’ve ordered the notes in this post in order of payoff: if you want to start optimizing but don’t know where to begin, the first few ideas on this list will probably give you the biggest bang for you buck.
</p>




<p>
  <h3>GZIP</h3>
  The biggest, easiest performance you can implement is gzipping HTML/JSON/JS/CSS/font file responses. It can drastically reduce the size of transferred files, but it’s easy to forget and isn’t in most default configs.<br/>
  - <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/content-compression-with-rack-deflater" target="_blank">Using Rack:Deflater</a><br/>
  - <a href="https://richonrails.com/articles/enabling-compression-for-nginx" target="_blank">Using nginx config</a><br/>
  - <a href="http://www.phpied.com/gzip-your-font-face-files/" target="_blank">Gzipping font files</a>
</p>




<p>
  <h3>keep-alive</h3>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection" target="_blank">keep-alive</a> is another easy win that speeds up asset delivery by reusing the existing connection between client and server. <a href="http://www.feedthebot.com/pagespeed/keep-alive.html" target="_blank">Turning it</a> on should be a no-brainer.
</p>




<p>
  <h3>Optimize user-uploaded Images</h3>
  You generally want to convert all uploaded images to JPGs, strip metadata, and optimize them as much as you can without heavy quality loss. Without this step, an admin or user can easily tank the pagesize by uploading a 24-bit PNG or similarly uncompressed image. I recommend <a href="https://github.com/markevans/dragonfly" target="_blank">Dragonfly</a> for on-the-fly image optimization — it lets front-end developers and designers fiddle with image details without needing to go back and update all your existing images on production after the change.
</p>




<p>
  <h3>Caching and CDNs</h3>
  <strong>Cache expiration</strong><br/>
  Set all assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts) to expire in a year, using either far-future expires or max-age Cache-Control headers. There are a lot of simple instructions available for setting this on <a href="https://viget.com/extend/http:/http:/guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#far-future-expires-header" target="_blank">the asset pipeline</a> and for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Expiration.html" target="_blank">CDN assets</a>.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Fingerprinting</strong><br/>
  If you set far-future caching, you need unique, fingerprinted filenames. The asset pipeline’s precompile command will already handle this, but in most cases it won’t happen automatically for user-uploaded assets. For example, if a user edits their avatar image locally and re-uploads it to the server with the same name, and you’re serving it with far-future expires headers, you’ll have a problem. If you’re uploading files with something like <a href="https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/182#issuecomment-601021" target="_blank">Carrierwave</a> or <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip#md5-checksum--fingerprint" target="_blank">Paperclip</a>, make sure you’re taking this step.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>CDN</strong><br/>
  Migrating user-uploaded images and Rails assets to a CDN can improve download time by moving asset servers “closer” to the user. Both caching and fingerprinting rules still apply to CDNs.
</p>




<p>
  <h3>SPDY</h3>
  SPDY is a networking protocol that can speed up page performance considerably, especially on pages with a lot of assets (<a href="http://www.httpvshttps.com/" target="_blank">example</a>). It’s available in the <a href="https://viget.com/extend/http:/http:/caniuse.com/#feat=spdy" target="_blank">majority of browsers</a> and ready for production use. It requires that you set up SSL, which is admittedly a hassle, but <a href="https://bugsnag.com/blog/spdy-on-rails" target="_blank">it isn’t much work beyond that</a>.
</p>




<p>
  <h3>Inlining assets</h3>
  (Note: If you're using SPDY, it's recommended that you DON'T inline your assets — <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-best-practices" target="_blank">see SPDY best practices</a>. <a href="http://viget.com/extend/rails-front-end-performance#comment-1775457785" target="_blank">Thanks Robert Fletcher!</a>)
</p>




<p>
  <strong>JS</strong><br/>
  As a general rule, loading JS in the head is a bad idea — <a href="https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/high-performance-sites-rule-6-move-scripts-bottom-7200.html" target="_blank">you want to move it to the bottom of the body</a>. However, in some cases moving it isn’t possible. If a design relies on Modernizr to add classes to the body as early as possible to create a consistent visual experience, Modernizr <a href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/878#issuecomment-41448059" target="_blank">needs to remain in the head</a>. In this case, try inlining the JS in a script tag instead of creating an extra, blocking request. This technique trades a faster initial pageload for slower subsequent pageloads (since subsequent loads will no longer load the file from browser cache). In a lot of cases the other pageloads are just barely slower, and it’s a good tradeoff.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>CSS</strong><br/>
  As a site grows, it becomes unreasonable to bundle all styles into a single application.css file. Users can end up viewing pages that load 100% of a site’s styles but only use 5-10%. In cases like this, you can break up page-specific styles into individual files and load them with <a href="https://gist.github.com/averyvery/45cede57d335fe0b6b55" target="_blank">a scheme that uses the controller/action to find CSS files</a>.
</p>




<p>
  Taking it further, there’s a good chance that if your view-specific CSS is small and users aren’t visiting many instances of the same view, making them request a second stylesheet isn’t necessary — just like with JS, you can inline them onto the page. <a href="https://gist.github.com/averyvery/6e4576023b395de1aaf5" target="_blank">Check out this gist for the setup I've used to inline CSS and JS assets in the past</a>.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Images</strong><br/>
  If you have pretty small images or single unique images on a view, it could be worthwhile to inline them as base64 strings instead of sending them as separate requests, using <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/base64/rdoc/Base64.html#strict_encode64-method" target="_blank">Ruby’s Base64 module</a>. (Warning: in IE8, your base64-encoded images need to be 32kb or smaller, or they simply won’t display.)
</p>




<p>
  <h3>jQuery and UJS</h3>
  Rails ships with jQuery 1.9.x and jquery-ujs built into application.js, but jQuery is a pretty big library, and presents some optimization opportunities:<br/>
  - Switch to jQuery 2.x — it’s smaller, but means dropping support for IE8. You could also use browser conditionals to load 1.9 for IE8 and below and 2.x for above, but you still want to combine jQuery into a single file with your other scripts, so you might end up with something like application-oldjquery.js and application.js.<br/>
  - Cut UJS, or cut them both — if you’re not using any UJS features, you can remove it, which might make jQuery an unnecessary dependency.
</p>




<p>
  At the time of this writing there’s no jQuery-less alternative for UJS, but it sounds like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/2fzk5z/what_does_rails_use_jquery_for_it_is_possible_to/ckeduvo" target="_blank">the team has considered the idea</a>.
</p>




<p>
  <h3>Pagespeed</h3>
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module" target="_blank">Google’s pagespeed module</a> gives you a number of tools that can speed up front-end performance by making minor tweaks (trimming the domain out of local URLs, inserting DNS prefetch tags, collapsing whitespace) or major ones (lazy-loading images). I encourage you to <a href="https://viget.com/extend/http:/https:/developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/download" target="_blank">install it</a> and investigate <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters" target="_blank">some of the filters</a>. Each filter has documented "Risks" that are worth reading before you implement — some of them, like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filter-quote-remove" target="_blank">remove quotes</a> are low-risk filters that you could probably implement today with no downside.
</p>




<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)

  <strong>Considerations when Open Sourcing</strong><br/>
  When open sourcing a gem (or any project, this post can be generalized to not just focus on gems), there are a number of things to consider. The first check is to ensure that the use case is general enough that it is likely to be helpful to other parties. Though the project might never gain many external users, it is a good sanity check before taking on the work to open source the project. Following this there are a number of things to think out, with the purpose of determining a track of work that needs to be taken (if any) before the gem can be open sourced.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Generalize the implementation</strong><br/>
  - Remove coupled business logic and application specific code.<br/>
  - Ensure no keys/account information were stored in the repo (even in past commits). Typically not considered a good practice, but it is something to be aware of when releasing the source of a project publicly.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Set bounds on the responsibilities</strong><br/>
  - What is the purpose of this gem and what needs is it fulfilling?<br/>
  - Take a step back from how you currently use the library. What other potential use cases might others use it for? Is it worth generalizing the implementation to aid these other use cases?<br/>
  - Set bounds on the responsibilities that the gem will take care of.<br/>
  - What will the gem provide and what is left up to the user? In the case of Signalman, we allow users to customize the URL of the Signalman admin page, but it is up to the user to provide additional authentication besides obscurity. Signalman is a gem designed to aid with A/B testing, not authentication.<br/>
  - Try to stick to the gem's core competencies. Do not add features at a whim to quell user requests. This can cause a gem to grow out of control and become hard to manage or even discern its original purpose/intent.
</p>




<p>
  <strong>Consider strategies to manage repository ownership</strong><br/>
  - Like it or not, becoming a maintainer is a big responsibility. If you are open sourcing a project with a team, this will greatly ease the burden, but you must still consider processes to manage external pull requests and issues that arise.<br/>
  - Giving the user power and encouraging pull requests and a community that supports each other's issues can also relieve the burden of being a project maintainer. You can help this process by adding documentation for contributing and making it easy for other parties to contribute to the project. This also means providing help to newer developers; you never know who might become a leading contributor in the future.
