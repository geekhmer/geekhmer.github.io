  Who is responsible for this madness? GeeKhmer was founded in 2013 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bunlongvan" target="_blank">Bunlong VAN</a>, a passionate Software Engineer with in depth knowledge of dozens of languages. Bunlong VAN has experience in dozens of languages, including Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Erlang, Chicagoboss and Javascript. Tired of merely programming, Bunlong decided it was time to give back to the community, and hence GeeKhmer was born.
