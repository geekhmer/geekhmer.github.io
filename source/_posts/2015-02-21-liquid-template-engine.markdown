<p>
  Liquid is a templating engine that allows you to enable your users to quickly and easily customize your views at run-time while maintaining the safety, security, and integrity of your servers.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Liquid Syntax</strong><br/>
  In liquid, there are two different types of markup.
</p>

<p>
  The first type of markup is output markup, is denoted by double sets of curly braces.
</p>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
{% raw %}
Hi {{ user.name }}
{% endraw %}
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
  The second type of markup is tag markup, is typically used for logic and control structures such as loops.
</p>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
{% raw %}
<ul>
  {% for user in users %}
    <li>{{ user.name }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endraw %}
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
  You can do basic if statements as well:
</p>

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
{% raw %}
{% if user.name != 'JingLong' %}
  Hi JingLong!
{% elsif user.name == 'Bunlong' %}
  Hey Bunlong!
{% else %}
  Hello {{ user.name }}
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
{% endcodeblock %}
