<p>
  Erlang is a programming language traditionally used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony, realtime application and instant messaging. Erlang’s runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

<p>
  <strong>High Availability/Reliability</strong><br/>
  - Simple and consistent error recovery and supervision hierarchiess.<br/>
  - Built-in fault tolerance.<br/>
  - Software upgrade (hot code loading) during runtime.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Scalability/Heterogeneity</strong><br/>
  - Run on a variety of platforms, supports heterogeneous networks.<br/>
  - Network aware runtime, out-of-the-box distributed architectures.<br/>
  - Lightweight processes, highly scalable transparent or explicit concurrency.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Less Effort</strong><br/>
  - Functional programming language, high abstraction level, concise readable programs.<br/>
  - 4–20 times less code compared to C/C++/Java.<br/>
  - Suitable for rapid prototyping.<br/>
  - Powerful middleware and libraries (OTP).
