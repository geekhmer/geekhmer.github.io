  Ruby on Rails is an innovation in development framework. It encompasses all the necessary elements to boost a web application’s performance. This framework is designed to address agile development and deliver productivity as well as flexibility to Ruby on Rails developers. Developed using Ruby programming language, it has transformed the world of web development through its practical approach.
</p>

<h3>Ruby on Rails is built upon two programming philosophies</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Convention over Configuration:</strong>
  Developers only need to write codes for the irregular or unconventional aspects of the web application.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Don’t Repeat Yourself:</strong>
  The data is stored in definite place. It saves time and reduces code.
</p>

<h3>Advantages of Ruby on Rails</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Faster Development:</strong>
  Rails framework enables the developers to write concise and clear syntax and produces fewer codes than its competitors. Therefore it requires less time to code and generates fewer errors. On the other hand it facilitates the programmers to maintain much less code. It is also enabled to integrate numerous tools to automate repetitive tasks such as managing database errors, creating forms etc... it simplifies development process because the language is lightweight and easily readable, almost like the natural language.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Increases Productivity:</strong>
  Rails framework is specifically featured to reduce the development aspects of applications, instead leveraging creativity and uniqueness of the web application. It empowers productivity by eliminating repetitive programming codes.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Assists Development of Creative Interfaces:</strong>
  Rails includes numerous integrations to enable developers in creating rich, intriguing user interfaces. Integrated JavaScript framework is easier to activate and features elements like apparition progressive, drag & drop and many more to ease the designing aspects of the application.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Model View Controller Design Pattern:</strong>
   Rails is developed on MVC architecture that separates the development logics from the presentation layer. It provides a well-structured application to the developers and the code is maintained in a logical and coherent manner.  It encourages abstraction in the application and enables the team to work on separate modules without depending on each other. It focuses on the features rather than minute details. Rails framework delivers ease of project development, conciseness and faster deployment of application.
</p>

<p>
  Rails Development makes web app development easier because it involves less coding while implementing new changes and updates into the development process. It enables the organizations to meet all the business requirements within the budget and schedule. So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)
