<p>
  I've been researching this for many days so I can help you at least find the ones out there. I don't have experience with most of these but the one I do have experience with is one I don't recommend as it seems unmaintained. Though I did find it well documented and easy to use. My requirements aren't particularly complicated for a data-grid component, I basically look at filtering, sorting and row selection. If you need anything more complicated you'll have to dig further into the documentations.
