  While I was writing my first article (<a href="http://geekhmer.github.io/blog/2014/06/26/why-erlang/">Why Erlang?</a>). I realized that since Erlang is not a popular programming language it would be nice to start an introduction to The Erlang Learning Sequence.
</p>

<p>
  I consider Erlang as a must-know language for an engineer that works with distributed systems and parallel programming. Believe me! in several cases Erlang is a problem solver.
</p>

<p>
  I will keep posting of short and example based. The approximation of the posts that I intend to write is:
</p>

<p>
  1. Introduction to Erlang & Chicagoboss Framework<br/>
  2. Variables<br/>
  3. Datatypes<br/>
  4. Modules and Compiling<br/>
  5. Functions<br/>
  6. Recursion<br/>
  7. Predefined Module<br/>
  8. List & List Module<br/>
  9. List Comprehension<br/>
  10. Concurrency (Processes)<br/>
  11. Message Passing<br/>
</p>

<p>
  So far so good, I will keep this list updated in case that I come up with new ideas! I hope I will convince you that Erlang worths for every software engineerâ€™s attention. see ya! :)
