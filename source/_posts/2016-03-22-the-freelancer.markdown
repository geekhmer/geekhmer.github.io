  Freelancer is a self-employed person who pursues a profession without a long-term commitment to any particular employer. Your curiosity in this opportunity was probably sparked by posts marked "Freelance" or "Work from anywhere" on the myriad of job boards around the Web. Freelancing is equal parts freedom and responsibility. While you have the freedom to choose when you work, where you work and what you work on, you are also responsible for everything: deadlines, finding work, the quality of your work, communication and so much more.

<p>
  So, your skill may be in Web development, Graphic design and your approach is to freelance, but it’s not that easy: freelancing is no walk in the park. It could become a living nightmare if you’re not able to use your time efficiently and remain focused and motivated until a project comes to a close. It could also become a nightmare if you market yourself poorly, are constantly desperate for work or surrender too much power to a client, putting you in the position of a monkey-worker responding to petty demands. The reasons I love being a freelancer:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Be your own boss</strong><br/>
  Report to no one but yourself. You will work on boring tasks.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Enjoy your freedom</strong><br/>
  You have the freedom to work when and where you please, the freedom to structure your day as you please.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Choose what to work on</strong><br/>
  Want to spend 50% of your time on open-source projects? Interested in building your own Web app? You have the power to make that a reality. Want to work exclusively on projects in social media? Make it happen.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Set your rates</strong><br/>
  Value is both a reflection of how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you. Are you capable of meeting deadlines, communicating well and delivering quality code?
</p>

<p>
  If you are just starting out, charging $80 per hour will be hard; you have to earn that rate over time and with experience.
</p>

<p>
  So far so good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)
