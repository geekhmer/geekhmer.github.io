<p>
  I always try to improve my development stack in order to gain productivity. And during the last few months, there has been a lot of change.
</p>

<p>
  Here is my current development stack that I use to create web apps:
</p>

<h3>
  Front-End
</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Bootstrap:</strong> A great HTML/CSS framework. It helps you build MVC very fast. Sass: A language compiled into CSS which adds many features such as variables, imports and functions.<br/>

  <strong>Jquery:</strong> Good old Jquery, indeed. I may start to use angular in the next few weeks if I have enough time.
</p>

<h3>
  Back-End
</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Ruby on Rails:</strong> The most productive web framework I have ever worked with, much faster than any PHP framework, and enforcing many good software engineering practices.<br/>
  <strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> Faster and most powerful than most RDBMS (including MySQL), and free.
</p>

<h3>
  Hosting
</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Heroku:</strong> A great PaaS, and free for small apps. I also tried Google App Engine but its lack of flexibility was a problem for me.<br/>
  <strong>Cloudflare:</strong> It makes your app load faster and gives you a free SSL certificate.<br/>
  <strong>Mandrill:</strong> Very easy to use, yet powerful, EaaS (Email as a Service). I use it to send transactional emails like welcome messages and password resets.
</p>

<h3>
  Deployment
</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Git:</strong> I configured it with a pre-commit hook which automatically runs rails tests. And thanks to Heroku a simple push deploys my code. It’s very useful and now I just couldn’t go back.
</p>

<h3>
  Monitoring
</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Pingdom:</strong> A great tool to receive alerts if your app goes down (and if you add IFTTT you can receive them by SMS).
</p>

<p>
  Let’s see what it looks like (with the help of a great website I recently found):
