<p>
  ReactJS components have three main parts of their lifecycle:<br/>
  - <strong><a href="/blog/2015/11/20/reactjs-component-lifecycle-mounting/">Mounting</a></strong>: A component is being inserted into the DOM.<br/>
  - <strong><a href="/blog/2015/11/21/reactjs-component-lifecycle-updating/">Updating</a></strong>: A component is being re-rendered to determine if the DOM should be updated.<br/>
  - <strong><a href="/blog/2015/11/21/reactjs-component-lifecycle-unmounting/">Unmounting</a></strong>: A component is being removed from the DOM.
</p>

<p>
  ReactJS provides lifecycle methods that you can specify to hook into this process. We provide <code>will</code> methods, which are called right before something happens, and <code>did</code> methods which are called right after something happens.
</p>

  So far go good, That's it!!! See ya!!! :)
