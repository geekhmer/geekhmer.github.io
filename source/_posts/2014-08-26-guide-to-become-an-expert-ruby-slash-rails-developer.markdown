  This guide is meant to help you acquire the fundamental skills you need to become a Ruby Developer. Using books, video courses, and projects, you’ll learn how to develop web applications using Ruby, HTML & CSS, jQuery, and Rails. Additionally, you will learn about best practices, design patterns and principles, and the fundamentals of visual design. The goal is to build a solid foundation that you can expand on to become an expert Ruby Developer.

  <strong>How To Use This Guide</strong><br/>
  The best way to use this guide is to start from the Ruby section and proceed towards the CoffeeScript and jQuery section. Each section has a Core Activity and an Assessment. The core activities are meant to teach you and the assessments are meant for you to practice solving problems on your own. There are additional readings for each section for the purposes of professional development. These readings can be done in-between study sessions or during your commute to work, but don’t skip them.  I encourage you to read the entire guide before you start doing anything. It’s a good idea to know where you will end up before you invest any time.
