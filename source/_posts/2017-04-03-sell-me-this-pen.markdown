<p>
  I personally never thought anyone would say, "Sell me this pen" in a sales interview. I was wrong. It will happen to you. And you should know exactly what to say back.
</p>

<p>
  I will give you the right sales framework to respond perfectly every time. One day it will happen to you and I want you prepare the script as below:
</p>

<p>
  Here we go:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Interviewer: Do me a favor, sell me this pen. (reaches across to hand me the pen)</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Me: (I slowly roll the pen between my index and thumb fingers.) When was the last time you used a pen?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Interviewer: This morning.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Me: Do you remember what kind of pen that was?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Interviewer: No.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Me: Do you remember why you were using it to write?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Interviewer: Yes. Signing a few new customer contracts.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Me: Well I'd say that's the best use for a pen.
</p>

<p>
  Would not you say signing those new customer contracts is an important event for the business? Then you shouldn't treate like this. What I mean is, here you are signing new customer contracts, an important and memorable event with a very unmemorable pen.
</p>

<p>
  This is the pen for more important events. This is the tool you use to get deals done. Think of it as a symbol for taking your company to the next level. Because when you begin using the right tool, you are in a more productive state of mind, and you begin to sign more new customer contracts.
</p>

<p>
  Actually. You know? Just this week I shipped ten new boxes of these pens to many office in Phnom Penh.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, this is my last pen today. So, I suggest you get this one. Try it out. If you are not happy with it, I will personally come back next week to pick it up. And it won't cost you a dime. What do you say?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Interviewer: Yes.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  See how simple that was. The Interviewer/Customer loved it. Why?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Here's the Simple Sales Framework for "Sell me this pen"</strong><br/>
  1. <code>Gather info</code> - Find out how they last used a pen<br/>
  2. <code>Respond to info</code> - Emphasize the importance of the activity they last used a pen<br/>
  3. <code>Delivery info</code> - Sell something bigger than a pen, like a state of mind<br/>
  4. <code>Closing</code> - Ask for the buy
</p>

<p>
  So far so good, remember it's not about actually selling a pen. It's about showing how well you can sell a product. Take 15 minutes today to practice the script above. I promise you will benefit. Share this with person in sales. It could save their career lolzzZ. See ya!
