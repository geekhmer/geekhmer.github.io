  <strong>1. Threaten them.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>2. Pay them lots of money.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>3. Make their work/work space fun.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  In today's workplace, threatening people has not been effective. Paying them lots of money (even if you can afford it) has only shown short-term success. Only number three, making their workplace enjoyable, has a track record of effecting real change. It is time managers learned how to create an atmosphere that is challenging, creative and fun for employees as well as for themselves.

FUN IS PRODUCTIVE

<p>
  Imagine a work world where people love their work environment, and they are calm, stress-free and happy all day long. People who are in good spirits are more likely to be productive. Their mental attitude produces increased oxygen, endorphins, and blood flow to the brain, which enables them to think more clearly and creatively. They are more relaxed, more accepting of others, and more likely to share their sense of humor.

<p>
  Laughter creates a bond that brings others together; people like to be with employees who are having fun. Creativity, intuition and flexibility are key to successful operation of organizations today. In stimulating environments, employees enjoy their time at work and they will also excel at work. A fun workplace is not only more productive, but it attracts people and profits.
