<h4>Good point of Ruby</h4>

<p>
  <strong>Reduce code</strong>
</p>

{% codeblock In Java lang:javascript %}
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    System.out.println(“Hello World”);
  }
}
{% endcodeblock %}

{% codeblock In Ruby lang:javascript %}
puts “Hellow World”
{% endcodeblock %}

<p>
  <strong>Communities</strong><br/>
  Ruby have large communities.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Code is Human-Readable</strong><br/>
  The code was designed from the start to be human-readable and this means that non-programmer can have a very easy to understand what a program is designed to do.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> (<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">www.ruby-lang.org</a>)<br/>
  A Model-View-Controller framework for creating database-driven websites in Ruby. Rails is build on simple concepts.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>RubyGems</strong> (<a href="https://rubygems.org/" target="_blank">www.rubygems.org</a>)<br/>
  A package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a “gem”), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Command-line</strong><br/>
  The interactive Ruby shell is a unique feature that allows developers to maintain and experiment with commands. There is no need to write webpages and check their functionality in a browser. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)</strong><br/>
  Object-Oriented-Programming is a necessity for clean and maintainable code. However, In Ruby, everything is an object.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Ruby is free</strong>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Encourage testing</strong><br/>
  - Test::Unit builds in into standard library<br/>
  - Other tools: Rspec, MiniTest, ...
