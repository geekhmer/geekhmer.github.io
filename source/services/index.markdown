  We serve startups from Asia Pacific Region and we run our company as a startup as well. We like to work with flexible, fun and smart people.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Tool</strong><br/>

</p>

<p>
  <strong>Project planning</strong><br/>

  - Trello for non code related activities.<br/>
  - Invision.<br/>
  - Proto.io.<br/>
  - Zeplin.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Communication</strong><br/>
  - We have worked with in-house and remote teams, and we have reached to the conclusion that our iterations are way faster when we are at the same office. It's also nice to talk about issues openly with your colleagues face to face, Skype calls with multiple people can be chaotic (remember when someone said i can't hear you?) and non-productive.<br/>
  - Hipchat. All the repositories and deployment activities are notified to specific rooms allowing us to track who is doing what. We believe in transparency so our clients and us are on the same page anytime.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>For deployment</strong><br/>
  - Digital Ocean/AWS/Heroku(sometimes) mainly as the projects we have done required low level adjustement. Heroku is not always a possibility.<br/>
  - Some githooks for specific tasks like updating i18n files.
</p>

<p>

  - New Relic.<br/>
  - Sentry.<br/>
  - Icinga.<br/>
  - Munin.
